What is a Content Management System (or CMS)? A CMS is a tool that helps
developers build websites. It is software that allows developers to
create, manage, and modify content on a website without requiring users
to have specialized technical knowledge. CMS is a general term for the
processes involved in developing a large-scale website. Well-managed
content makes a website more useful to visitors and valuable to the
person or organization who owns the website.

A CMS has two core parts: 
  1. The Content Management Application (CMA) is a software tool that enables developers to add and manage content on a website.
  2. And the Content Delivery Application (CDA) is the back-end process that takes the content you put into the CMA, stores it properly, and makes it visible to 
     website visitors.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image007.png" alt="image007" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.7841885389326335in"} -->

There are three common types of content management systems. A Web
Content Management System (WCMS) controls the content on many digital
channels. It also manages and handles HTML documents and associated
images. A WCMS enables developers to maintain an extensive collection of
web documents and materials. A Digital Asset Management System (DAMS)
focuses on the customer experience (CX). It enables the correct delivery
of content to the users and centralizes assets, content, workflows, and
operations. And an Enterprise Content Management System (ECMS) collects,
stores, delivers, and manages unstructured data, enables delivery of the
correct content to targeted audiences, and archives files after a set
time.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image008.png" alt="image008" style="width:300px;"/>

<!-- {width="3.0in" height="1.6756408573928259in"} -->

There is both proprietary and open-source CMS software. Some examples
are WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento, Squarespace, Wix, and HubSpot.
Some of these are software you can install on your website host, for
example, Wordpress.org, Drupal, and Joomla. Others are available as
hosted services like WordPress.com, HubSpot, and Wix. Many kinds of CMS
software are available, depending on how developers want to use them.

<p align="center">

</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.7927351268591427in"} -->

So why use a CMS? Instead of creating a new web page or designing a new
website, many solutions exist that can function how designers want.

A CMS makes a recognizable and comfortable website and is quick and easy
for developers and organizations to manage. Some people use content
management systems to create content for many reasons, like creating and
managing. Static websites, membership sites, blogs, forums, social
networking sites, e-commerce stores, online courses, and portfolios.

One of the biggest benefits is that users can create websites quickly
and easily because they need little to no programming language
background. Another benefit is scheduled updates. Updates to content and
the website are easy to make. Some CMS software also prepares for
publishing and updates. Affordability is a huge benefit of using CMS
software. Instead of using a large web development team, websites can be
managed by a smaller group or by a person, reducing the website\'s cost.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image011.png" alt="image011" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.7927351268591427in"} -->

CMS software also provides tools to allow users to customize their
website, regardless of the company size or the user's needs. Many CMSs
include drag-and-drop interfaces and visual editors for building
websites rather than coding them.

CMSs have templates and third-party extensions that make it easy to
customize the website and extend its capabilities.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image012.png" alt="image012" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.7927351268591427in"} -->

So how do you choose a CMS? In the planning stage of the software
development cycle, you\'ll consider what you need to help you create and
manage a website. You\'ll ask:

-   How big does your website need to be to meet your organization\'s
    needs?

-   Who will be using your website?

-   What functionality do you and your users need to have?

-   What skills do you need to have to develop the website?

-   And does your CMS need other technologies or software to work with
    it?

Once you\'ve answered these questions, you're ready to choose the best
CMS for you and your website!

## 02. Features of Web CMS
<!-- {#features-of-web-cms .unnumbered} -->

<https://www.coursera.org/learn/intermediate-web-and-front-end-development/lecture/BWeid/features-of-web-cms>

<p align="center">

<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.801281714785652in"} -->

Welcome to "Features of Web CMS."

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image015.png" alt="image015" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.801281714785652in"} -->

After watching this video, you will be able to: describe a Web Content
Management System (WCMS) and its types, identify the characteristics of
the Web Content Management System, and explain Enterprise Content
Management System (ECMS).

In today's digital world, an organization must manage and update its
official website regularly. An organization needs to enable technical
and non-technical end users to create and manage the content on its
website.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image016.png" alt="image016" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.801281714785652in"} -->

This is made possible by Web Content Management System (WCMS). It is a
program that helps users create, manage, modify, and publish content on
a web page. A user interacts with a Web Content Management System
through a standard web browser. Users store the content in a database
using programming languages like XML and .Net.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image017.png" alt="image017" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.801281714785652in"} -->

Let's discuss the two kinds of WCMSs: no-code and code. You can choose
between the two based on your requirements, technical skills, and the
time needed to create a web page. Technical and non-technical users
adopt the no-code approach to develop a web page using a graphical user
interface. Note that users do not have to write code for the
development. The no-code approach allows the user to review the page
before it is published. No-code is easier, quicker, cheaper, and ideal
for beginners and small businesses. The other type of development, code,
enables a user to create a fully customizable web page with unique
features. In this case, the user needs basic knowledge of programming
languages, such as HTML, CSS, and PHP, to create, customize, and host
web pages. We will now talk about the essential characteristics of WCMS.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image018.png" alt="image018" style="width:450px;"/>
  <img src="./assets/images/image019.png" alt="image019" style="width:450px;"/>
</p>
<!-- {width="3.50086176727909in" height="1.9608989501312335in"} -->
<!-- {width="3.5in" height="1.960896762904637in"} -->

A WCMS enables a user to accomplish specific tasks. Some of these
include:

-   Creating web pages quickly with pre-set page layouts and content
    blocks.

-   Reviewing and approving the content before

-   it is published. Automating the publishing process.

-   Editing and formatting the content using simple drag-and-drop tools.

-   Collaborating with different users to create and modify the content,
    and

-   Scaling and implementing change to multiple domains easily and
    quickly.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image020.png" alt="image020" style="width:300px;"/>

</p>
<!-- {width="3.0in" height="3.28in"} -->
<!-- {width="3.0in" height="3.28in"} -->

Here are the additional tasks that a WCMS enables a user to accomplish:

-   Managing the life cycle of a document, including creation,
    revisions, publication, archive, and removal.

-   Translating and publishing content in different languages easily.

-   Saving and retrieving different versions of a web page.

-   Updating a web page as per the latest web standards quickly.

-   Adding plugins to enhance the functionality of a web page, and

-   Managing user access to a particular page on a website.

</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.796474190726159in"} -->

Enterprise Content Management System (ECM) allows businesses to manage
content throughout their lifecycle intelligently. A Web Content
Management System is a subset of an Enterprise Content Management
System. It primarily focuses on web content. An Enterprise Content
Management System integrates software tools with an organization's
strategy and aligns with its routine business operations.

</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.796474190726159in"} -->

In this section, you learned that:

-   A WCMS enables users to create, manage, and modify content on a web
    page.

-   There are two kinds of WCMSs:

    -   No code enables both technical and non-technical users to
        develop a website,

    -   and Code enables a user to create customizable web pages.

-   A WCMS has several features that an end user can use to create and
    manage the content on their website.

## 03. Popular CMS Platforms/Tools
<!-- {#popular-cms-platformstools .unnumbered} -->

Welcome to "Popular CMS platforms/tools."

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image025.png" alt="image025" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.8050207786526684in"} -->

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain Headless Content Management System (CMS),

-   and Identify popular CMS platforms and tools.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image026.png" alt="image026" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.8050218722659666in"} -->

Headless content management systems (CMSs) have gained popularity
recently and are set to replace traditional CMSs. A conventional CMS
needs more flexibility for content reuse or formatting. Once published,
a content asset is in its final state and can be neither reused nor
formatted. If a user wants to customize a traditional CMS, the best they
can do is add a plugin, which is more like a Band-Aid. On the other
hand, a "headless" CMS offers true integration as new functionalities or
features can be added to a website easily and comprehensively. Today, we
live in a world that is Omni channel. Unlike in the past, users now
consume data on different channels. Hence, from an organizational
perspective, the content developed for the organization's website must
also be uploaded on other channels such as apps or newsletters. Any
change made at a centralized location is implemented everywhere where it
matters. This is the power that a headless CMS has.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image027.png" alt="image027" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.8050218722659666in"} -->

The headless approach enables organizations to deliver content to
different channels, such as mobile applications or JavaScript
applications running on a browser, email blasts, and social media
campaigns. In this type of architecture, the backend, the CMS, or the
body, is separated from the front end, the presentation layer, or the
head. Therefore, it is called a headless CMS. A headless CMS platform
ensures that, regardless of the device a customer uses to interact with
a brand, their experience is consistent. A headless CMS architecture is
less susceptible to cyber security threats as the back end is separated
from the front end.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image028.png" alt="image028" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.8050218722659666in"} -->

WordPress is one of the most popular CMS platforms. It accounts for more
than 60% of the CMS market. It offers the flexibility and freedom to
build and run any type of website without a developer. It has a hugely
supportive community and offers more extensibility through different
plugins and apps. It supports SEO, and you can control how to earn
online from the website you own. Another popular CMS is Joomla, which
comes with many different templates and extensions. Joomla is ideal for
developers and experienced website creators. It has a large pool of
extensions that gives plenty of design options and constant feature
updates.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image029.png" alt="image029" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.8050218722659666in"} -->

The next popular CMS that we are going to discuss is Squarespace. It's
an integrated platform where you can build your website and blog, host
content, and sell your products and services. You need to sign up for
the subscription, and Squarespace will make it easy for you to build a
website from scratch, which is handy if you don't have web development
experience or need to get a website up and running in a short time. We
will now explore another functional CMS, which is Wix. It is a
cloud-based web development platform that lets you create HTML5 and
mobile-optimized websites easily. The platform offers a drag-and-drop
system and you can add more functionalities by adding plugins. One can
use Wix for various purposes, such as email marketing, e-commerce,
contact forms, and community forums. You can choose from different plans
based on your requirement.

<p align="center">

</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.8050218722659666in"} -->

Shopify is a popular CMS platform for developing e-commerce websites.
It's an all-in-one website builder and content management system with
built-in payment processing for selling online. The software offers
tools to build a brand, sell on social media platforms and online
marketplaces, and process in-person sales with Shopify POS. Shopify
makes it easy for you to manage every aspect of product sales. You can
set variants, allow inventory tracking, adjust pricing, add weights,
change the order of your products, and do more. You can create, edit,
and manage blogs, landing pages, and other navigation elements besides
managing products.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image031.png" alt="image031" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

Drupal is a free and open-source CMS. It's not as popular as WordPress
and Joomla in terms of market share but is impressive in delivering
higher performance. It offers the flexibility to create and manage
custom post types. You'll also benefit from the high level of control
that it offers users and permissions. Drupal also can deliver
multilingual websites right out of the box, enabling your business to
reach a wider audience. Adobe Commerce, earlier known as Magento,
targets companies that want to take their customers' online shopping
experience to the next level. This software is not meant for beginners.
It's mostly used mainly by mid-market and enterprise businesses and B2B
organizations that need complete customization at a scale. Another
highlight of this software is its ability to create a progressive web
app (PWA) for your online store.

<p align="center">

Headless CMSs have become increasingly popular and are set to replace
traditional CMSs. WordPress offers the flexibility to build and run any
type website. Joomla, Squarespace, Wix, Shopify, Drupal, and Adobe
Commerce are all popular CMS platforms.

## 05. Web Development with CMS - Part 1
<!-- {#web-development-with-cms---part-1 .unnumbered} -->

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image033.png" alt="image033" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

Welcome to "Web development with CMS - Part 1."

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image034.png" alt="image034" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

After watching this video, you will be able to: Explain important
elements of a web development plan. Define best practices for a
successful business website.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image035.png" alt="image035" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

In today's competitive world, a website is essential for a business
owner to acquire new and loyal customers. However, before the website
launch, planning is necessary. A lot is done before the actual coding
for the website starts. A web development plan needs to be in place.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image036.png" alt="image036" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

Let's discuss the five important elements of this plan.

These include:

-   Developing a web strategy,

-   Adopting a global approach,

-   Creating page templates,

-   Focusing on personalization,

-   Leveraging user and group roles.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image037.png" alt="image037" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

Let's discuss each of them in detail.

An important element of a web development plan is developing a web
strategy. A web strategy lays the foundation for a website's build and
design. It's a comprehensive plan that takes into account various
aspects.

Some of these include:

-   Aims and objectives of the business,

-   Geographic reach,

-   Marketing goals,

-   Brand identity tone and essence, and

-   Financial targets.

Having a web strategy ensures that:

Your web design is in line with your web goals, and yhe website that the
designers and developers create functions as per your business goals.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image038.png" alt="image038" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

Adopting a global approach is the next important element of a web
development plan. In the 21st century, the growth of the internet has
created a mindset of "going global." Businesses, regardless of their
size, are aiming to capture new markets. As a result, developers have to
ensure their websites are valuable and accessible to a wide and diverse
range of international customers. They need to adopt a global
modular approach. Measures need to be put in place at the outset so that
adaptation later is as easy as possible. You will not have to edit every
page if your website needs an update.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image039.png" alt="image039" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

The other important element of a web development plan is the creation of
page templates. A website template is a pre-defined layout that enables
a developer to arrange a website's content to make it appealing to
users. If you plan to develop a website using a template, you don't need
coding experience. You need to select a template based on the nature and
purpose of your website. You can customize the template according to
your business's goals. This will help you save time, money, and effort.
A website developed using a template can be updated easily and
regularly.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image040.png" alt="image040" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

Today, every visitor to a website expects a customized user experience.
This is why focusing on personalization is an important element of a web
development plan. With customization, you can target your audience and
give them a tailored experience across all platforms. Additionally, you
can manage all web-based projects online, regardless of where you deploy
them, and give autonomy to marketing. As an API works seamlessly across
all channels, personalized information appears for each visitor,
regardless of how they access the website or what device they use. By
providing content tailored to each visitor's taste, content
recommendations personalize every visitor's digital experience.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image041.png" alt="image040" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

The last element of a web development plan that we are going to be
discussing is leveraging user and group roles. Member roles are
systematic assignments of privileges to members. These include general
rights for groups, system preferences, content, analysis tools, and
sharing. A group with more rights than the general group is given
administrative privileges. Administrators can leverage pre-existing
roles and build new ones to suit their user base.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image042.png" alt="image042" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

Now, we will explore some best practices for creating a successful
business website. Ensure that your website makes the best use of search
engine crawlers. Ensure Google and other popular search engines can
easily find your website. Use a CMS to manage your website\'s content.
Use an optimizer tool or an image optimization service to optimize
images for SEO. Use an insights tool or an online speed testing service
to optimize text for SEO. Use fonts optimized for website readability
rather than typefaces that might be too small or too big for some
devices or browsers. Use JavaScript to enhance your website's
functionality. Use CSS to style the graphics and text on your website.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image043.png" alt="image043" style="width:500px;"/>

## 06. Web Development with CMS - Part 2
<!-- {#web-development-with-cms---part-2 .unnumbered} -->

</p>

Welcome to "Web development with CMS."

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image045.png" alt="image045" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

After watching this video, you will be able to: Identify the types of
pages of a website. Explain the features of a CMS.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image046.png" alt="image046" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

Each page of a website plays a vital role in its functioning. For users
to easily navigate and access content, it is crucial that each page
functions effectively and meets the user's needs. In this video, we will
explore different types of pages of a website developed using a CMS.
These include:

-   Front page,

-   Post page,

-   List or category page,

-   Search page,

-   User or author profile,

-   and User home or dashboard.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image047.png" alt="image047" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

Let's discuss each page in detail. The first type of page that we are
going to talk about is the front page. This page is the formal entry
point and is like a homepage. It helps highlight what is crucial,
especially when there is a vast amount of content to access. It
typically shows concise versions of posts. The next type of page is the
posting page. A "post" is the central component of a CMS-driven
application. The posting page displays all of the public information
about a post. The purpose of this type of page is to display timely and
regularly updated content. It could be an informational page about a
person, group, event, product, and so on.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image048.png" alt="image048" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

Now, we will talk about the list or category page. Well-organized
website content improves user experience. A developer, therefore, needs
to use lists and categories effectively. A category helps classify your
content, create a logical structure for your website, and enhance the
users\' reading experience. Users can browse through posts on a list or
category page and filter them according to categories, attributes, or
other criteria. A "sort" option is often available on this page when
there is a significant volume of content to scroll through. A category
page benefits a user in getting what they're looking for instantly and
enables the website owner to keep their website structured. Another type
of page of a website is the search page. A dedicated search page is
unnecessary for smaller applications but can be beneficial. It can be
integrated or merged with the list or category page.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image049.png" alt="image049" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

The next type of page is the user or author profile. Any author or user
that creates one or multiple posts has a dedicated page. Blogs with a
single author and small news sites occasionally skip this page. However,
this page is essential for content-driven social networks, sizeable
multi-author news websites, and other user-generated apps. Listing all
the user's posts on this page is a customary and practical practice. The
last type of page we will explore in this session is the user's home or
dashboard. This page displays content tailored to the needs or
preferences of the user currently logged in, such as status updates,
personal newsfeeds, recent activities, and recommended content. A
dashboard is essential for social networks and gated applications but
optional or irrelevant for others.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image050.png" alt="image050" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

Now, we are going to discuss the features of a CMS. Despite slight
variations in design, every CMS has the same fundamental features. You
can create the content of your website using different CMS features.
Some of these include: Page design, Blog content, and Content storage.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image051.png" alt="image051" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

The most important feature of a CMS is designing a page. A developer can
start designing a page using a template or a blank canvas. The selection
depends on the type of CMS you use. Using a template, you can start
adding content to a page immediately. If you do not use a template, you
must arrange the page elements and place them where you want. This
feature lets you view the content in the What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get
(WYSIWYG) editor. This editor displays your content as if you were
looking at a word processor. As a result, you can see what the end user
will view on your page. You can even switch to an HTML view to edit the
code. Another valuable feature of a CMS is developing blog content. CMSs
also allow you to create blogs in the system directly. To create a blog,
first, you must create a container page and link the blog page to other
blogs. Even though it might appear complicated, this feature enables you
to reuse the same content on various websites. Businesses that rely
significantly on digital marketing can save time as they can produce
content and use it across different parts of a website and advertising
channels.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image052.png" alt="image052" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

The last feature of a CMS that we will discuss in this session is
content storage. This feature of a CMS allows you to store all your
content in a centralized place and make it accessible anywhere. Almost
all CMSs will have some content repository. You can upload an image or
file to your CMS. Or, pull it from your content library when you want to
place it on a specific site. CMSs also allow you to review and approve
the content before publication.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image053.png" alt="image053" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

In this section, you learned that: A CMS helps in developing several
types of pages on a website. The types of pages include the:

-   Front Page,

-   Post Page,

-   List or Category Page,

-   Search Page,

-   User or Author Profile, and

-   User Home or Dashboard, among others.

Some of the features of a CMS include page design, blog content, and
content storage.

## 07. Getting Started with WordPress - Part 1
<!-- {#getting-started-with-wordpress---part-1 .unnumbered} -->

Welcome to "Getting started with WordPress - Part 1."

After watching this video, you will be able to: define WordPress as a
Content Management System (CMS) and describe key concepts related to
WordPress WordPress is a CMS that helps you build and manage your
website. It serves as a foundation for your content and allows you to
install plugins that enhance your website\'s functionality and design.

WordPress CMS gives you greater flexibility and control over your
website and content than What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) website
builders. You may want to use WYSIWYG website builders for their ease of
use. However, they are frequently feature-limited and require you to
host with a specific company. WordPress allows you to constantly update
your website\'s design, content, and functionality. WordPress is a good
fit for your projects and websites due to several factors. These include
the ease of customization, excellent performance, and highly robust
features that allow a CMS to run a wide range of websites, including
blogs, business, and e-commerce sites. There are two common platforms:
WordPress.org and WordPress.com. WordPress.org is a platform where you
can download CMS, themes, and plugins. Wordpress.org does not provide
web hosting packages, so it encourages you to self-host a WebPress
installation by directing you to third-party hosts. Some of these
services also offer dedicated WordPress hosting plans. A2, Bluehost, and
WP Engine are some options to consider. A self-hosted WordPress
installation allows you to install any theme or plugin. Wordpress.com is
a blogging platform owned by Automattic, co-founded by WordPress
developer Matt Mullenweg.

Wordpress.com differs from Wordpress.org as it offers free and paid
hosting options. It, however, does have a few limitations. For example,
none of WordPress. com\'s offerings allow you to access your server via
Secure Shell (SSH) or edit code via File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
However, you can do so with Wordpress.org, as you must use it with a
third-party host.

You can install third-party plugins with WordPress.com\'s top-tier
business plan. Users, developers, or both should know certain concepts
and terminologies related to WordPress. These include the following
terms: Database, WordPress Core, plugins, themes, hooks, customization
options, and Rest API. Let's discuss each of these in detail now. A
database contains all your website\'s content, settings, and dynamic
information. WordPress officially supports the database engines MySQL
and MariaDB. WordPress includes every essential file needed for a
WordPress website to function. This is available for download from
Wordpress.org or as part of your hosting package. Plugins are pieces of
code you can write yourself or download from places like the WordPress
Plugin repository. Plugins can add new features and behaviors to your
website. Themes enable you to personalize and control the visual aspects
of your website. They determine the look and feel of the public-facing
website. Themes, like plugins, are created from scratch or pre-made.
There are two types of Themes. Classic themes allow users to make minor
adjustments, such as adding custom logos or colors. It is an older style
of theming. Block themes are more modular. They provide users with more
customization options and require less coding. The Block Theme system is
the future of WordPress theming. Hooks are the foundation of the
WordPress core, themes, and plugins. There are two types of hooks:
actions and filters. Action hooks allow you to add more functionalities
to the website. Filter hooks allow you to modify the function's existing
code. They intercept the data being processed, let you change it, and
then pass it back. Customization options offer different approaches
depending on the type of customization and functionality you want to add
to your website.

There are two types: visual changes facilitated by themes and functional
changes implemented by plugins. The Rest API is new and allows you to
build true WordPress applications. These include iPhone, Android, and TV
apps if you are familiar with other programming languages. In this
video, you learned: WordPress is a CMS that helps you build and manage
your website. Wordpress.org is a platform where you can download CMS,
themes, and plugins. Wordpress.com is a blogging platform that offers
free and paid hosting options. Plugins are pieces of code you can write
yourself or download from places like the WordPress Plugin repository.
Themes enable you to personalize and control the visual aspects of your
website. Hooks are the foundation of how the WordPress core, themes, and
plugins work. Customization options offer different approaches depending
on the type of customization and functionality you want to add to your
website.

## 08. Getting Started with WordPress - Part 2
<!-- {#getting-started-with-wordpress---part-2 .unnumbered} -->

Welcome to "Getting started with WordPress -- Part 2." After watching
this video, you will be able to: Describe the popular website builder,
WordPress. Identify the steps to create a website using WordPress.
Identify the skills required to enhance WordPress. WordPress is a
user-friendly platform that enables you to develop a professional
website without coding knowledge.

This video will teach you how to create a website using WordPress.

The steps to create a website using WordPress include the following:

-   Selecting a domain name,

-   Setting up web hosting Installing WordPress,

-   Selecting a theme for your website,

-   Designing the homepage and creating additional web pages,

-   Installing plugins,

-   Creating navigation menus and,

-   Integrating your social media with the website.

Let's discuss each of these steps in detail.

The first step of creating a website using WordPress is selecting a
domain name. Your domain name is the permanent Internet address for your
WordPress website and plays a crucial role in branding, so give it some
thought. After you\'ve found the perfect domain name, get that
registered with a domain name registrar. Some popular registrars include
GoDaddy and Google Domains.

The next step in creating a website using WordPress is setting up web
hosting. Web hosting is the \"engine\" that powers your WordPress
website and allows visitors from all over the world to access it. Web
hosting means renting computer space to power your website. Hosting is
available at all price points, ranging from a few dollars to hundreds
per month. Next, you need to install the WordPress software. Most
WordPress hosting companies provide simple tools to install free
WordPress software. The hosting package you select will typically
include instructions on installing the software, which will require
downloading and uploading the software or using a quick installation
method. Using a managed WordPress hosting account, you\'ll be able to
install and use the software immediately.

After you've installed the WordPress software, you need to select a
theme for your website. Your WordPress theme determines how your website
appears.

WordPress allows you to customize your website without any specialized
knowledge. Using a high-quality theme gives your website a professional
appearance while adhering to the latest web standards and conventions. A
free theme will suffice if you want to post a simple blog. Premium
themes typically have advanced functionalities and no branding from the
creator. Look for frequently updated themes to ensure that your website
stays current.

After selecting the theme of your website, you need to design the
homepage and the additional pages of your website. To create an
excellent first impression, you must identify the essential things you
want your users to access when visiting your website. You can use either
a blank webpage or a pre-designed page layout provided by WordPress to
develop that impressive homepage quickly.

Next, you need to create additional web pages for your website. These
may include the About Us page, the Contact page, the Privacy Policy
page, the custom landing page, and so on.

Now, to boost the functionality of your website, you can install
plugins. Note that this step is optional. While themes are concerned
with appearance, plugins are concerned with adding new functionality to
your website.

WordPress offers tools to improve search engine optimization (SEO),
create user forums, and manage comments. One important consideration is
that coding errors from a plugin developer may leave your website
vulnerable to cyberattacks. Hence, research before you install one.

The next step is creating navigation menus. Users can browse different
pages or sections of your website using navigation menus. Menus are
links at the top of a web page that users can click to navigate your
website. WordPress includes a robust navigation menu system, which your
WordPress theme uses to display menus.

The last and optional step is integrating your social media with your
website. This helps you to enhance brand reach and awareness, encourage
engagement, and enable you to reach a wider audience, boosting traffic
to your website. WordPress allows you to add various icons related to
social media platforms. These include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
YouTube, and others. It also allows you to post online or redirect users
to your social media profiles. You must be familiar with specific tools
to begin working with WordPress development and website design.

Let us understand the skills required for enhancing WordPress. The
following skills are:

-   Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

-   Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

-   Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)

-   JavaScript (JS)

-   My structured Query Language (MySQL)

HTML and CSS are the first two languages you should learn. No matter
what code you write or the language you use, it all comes down to HTML
and CSS.

HTML is responsible for giving a website its structure. This implies
deciding what text should be a heading, what should be a list, what goes
in the sidebar, and what goes in the header and footer.

CSS is used for adding styles to the HTML structure. You can define the
color of text, image alignment, paragraph spacing, border colors, border
thickness, float properties, and other elements.

WordPress development requires a solid understanding of PHP as WordPress
and other content management systems are developed using the PHP
programming language.

JavaScript is commonly used on websites for asynchronous loading and
adding dynamic functionality to web pages.

MySQL is a database-access and data-management language. WordPress
relies on it to retrieve all its data.

In this video, you learned that:

-   WordPress is a user-friendly platform that enables you to develop a
    professional website without the knowledge of coding, and

-   The steps to create a website using WordPress include:

    -   selecting a domain name,

    -   setting up web hosting,

    -   installing WordPress,

    -   designing the homepage and

    -   creating additional webpages,

    -   installing plugins,

    -   creating navigation menus, and

    -   integrating your social media with the website.

Businesses must adapt to the new online world to remain relevant and
profitable. Those who depend on customers visiting a storefront must
shift to an entirely new business model to survive. Suppose you run a
business that sells physical products. In that case, it is possible to
transition to an e-commerce business to keep things afloat in the coming
months. And, for most businesses, adding an e-commerce store to its
existing website is surprisingly easy. How you achieve this depends on
how you build your website. However, like most businesses, if you\'re
either using WordPress website or a website builder to create your
website, adding e-commerce functionality is simple.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/image057.png" alt="image057" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

The global consultancy firm AT Kearney stated, \"e-commerce is the next
frontier in global expansion. Global e-commerce has grown by thirteen
percent over the last five years. As online sales skyrocket in
developing markets, an online presence is a low-risk way to test new
markets and complement existing store footprints." E-commerce is easy
and affordable. It allows you to sell locally and globally every hour of
every day.

</p>
<!-- {width="5.0in" height="2.671474190726159in"} -->

Adding e-commerce features to a website requires a certain degree of
technical knowledge. Here are some ways to add e-commerce to your
website, depending on your platform's complexity level, business needs,
and the available budget. Start selling products online. For new
sellers, marketplaces are accessible, affordable options. Add a "Sell"
button to your website. You can create buttons online or quickly add a
shopping basket to your website. Using drag-and-drop website builder
software will help you easily create high-converting landing pages, web
pages, and blog posts.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image059.png" alt="image059" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

The first option is to add a store to your website. This option is great
if you have full permission to edit your website. You can add payment
gateways and shopping carts to make your website e-commerce capable. To
add e-commerce functionalities, you can use numerous third-party tools
or plugins. These plugins are software that add various functionalities
to a website, including web form builders, analytics, SEO meta tags,
payment gateways, and shopping carts.

If you're a lucky owner of WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal websites,
installing a plugin will be the most viable way to add e-commerce
features to your website. The process of adding a plugin to your
e-commerce platform is easy. Go to Plugins in the admin dashboard,
select the one compatible with your website version, and click
"Install." Installing the following plugins will add e-commerce features
to your CMS: WordPress and WooCommerce, Joomla and Hikashop, Drupal and
Drupal Commerce, and Wix and Wix Stores.

<p align="center">

Online marketplaces are beneficial to all. The buyer finds e-commerce
platforms convenient and secure places to purchase goods immediately.
The seller is attracted to marketplaces by potential customers.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image062.png" alt="image062" style="width:500px;"/>
</p>

Let's discuss some easy ways to include marketplaces on your website.
WooCommerce, WP e-commerce, and BigCommerce are service providers that
allow you to create an online store. If you have WordPress installed,
enter the "marketplace" query on the official WordPress repository.
Select a plugin that will turn your online store into a marketplace.
WooCommerce allows you to sell the products of only one seller. Magento
Open Source is suited for medium- to large-scale enterprises but offers
an open-source edition for small businesses.

Shopify has a \"Buy\" button to add to a custom or template website. It
shows users product images, descriptions, and prices. It allows them to
stay on your website while making a purchase. You can customize this
button to make it a part of your website. The solution costs a few
dollars monthly and requires little effort to integrate into the
existing website.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/image063.png" alt="image063" style="width:500px;"/>

dashboard. The former is what everyone sees when they visit your site,
including your inventory, deals, shopping cart, checkout system, and so
on. You see the latter, including sales, inventory, and other things.
You need to find an e-commerce partner that enables you to have an
attractive e-commerce store and an intuitive back-end dashboard.

# 10. Introduction to Search Engine Optimization (SEO) {#introduction-to-search-engine-optimization-seo .unnumbered}

![](./assets/images/image067.png){width="5.0in"
height="2.8301279527559053in"}

Welcome to "Introduction to Search Engine Optimization (SEO)."

![](./assets/images/image068.png){width="5.0in"
height="2.8301279527559053in"}

After watching this video, you will be able to:

-   Describe search engine optimization (SEO) and its types,

-   and Identify the benefits of using SEO.

![](./assets/images/image069.png){width="5.0in"
height="2.8301279527559053in"}

Search engine optimization (SEO) refers to techniques that help a
website rank higher in organic search results, making it more visible to
people looking for the product or service online. Search engines scan
the Internet for text that matches certain criteria. This text, a
crucial website element, is called a keyword. The titles, headings, and
links that form the content of a webpage are also important factors that
a search engine considers when ranking a website. SEO is a subset of
Search Engine Marketing (SEM), a broad term that contains all search
marketing strategies. Organic and paid searches are both included in
SEM. Paid search requires you to pay to have your website listed on a
search engine so that it appears when someone types a specific keyword
or phrase.

![](./assets/images/image070.png){width="5.0in"
height="2.8301279527559053in"}

Let's describe how a search engine works. A search engine needs an
archive of available information to choose from to display results when
someone types a query. Every search engine has proprietary methods to
gather and prioritize website content, known as indexing. A search
engine index is a data collection used to generate the final search
result. Search engines scan the Internet and index all the information
displayed to users when they enter a search query. Every search engine
has bots, or crawlers, that crawl the web constantly, indexing websites
for content and following links on each webpage to other web pages.
Indexing your website is essential as it will only appear in search
results if it is done.

![](./assets/images/image071.png){width="5.0in"
height="2.8344017935258092in"}

Now that you know how search engines work, let's explore the types of
SEO. Some of these include technical SEO, on-page SEO, and off-page SEO.
Let's discuss each of them in detail.

![](./assets/images/image072.png){width="5.0in"
height="2.8344017935258092in"}

Technical SEO, as the name suggests, relates to the settings that need
to be set up to facilitate the task of search engine crawlers. Note that
crawling and indexing issues can harm your rankings. Another type of SEO
is on-page SEO, which is primarily concerned with the content and other
elements found on a page. Unlike technical SEO, on-page SEO primarily
aims to provide enough signals to search engine crawlers so that they
can understand the meaning and context of the content. This is done
using website structure, SEO keywords, title optimizations, headings,
internal links, image SEO, structured data markup, and other techniques.
When done correctly, on-page SEO will improve a website\'s or blog\'s
usability and credibility.

![](./assets/images/image073.png){width="5.0in"
height="2.8344017935258092in"}

The last type of SEO we will discuss is off-page SEO. It refers to
actions taken away from the website to influence the rankings on Search
Engine Result Pages or (SERPs). Off-page SEO is commonly associated with
the creation of backlinks. Search engines use backlinks to determine the
quality of the connected content. Hence, a website with many high-value
backlinks usually ranks higher than an otherwise equal website with
fewer backlinks.

![](./assets/images/image074.png){width="5.0in"
height="2.8344017935258092in"}

Now, we will talk about the benefits of using SEO. Most users click one
of the top five SERP suggestions. The website must rank among the top
results to capitalize on this and attract visitors. SEO is about search
engines and good SEO practices, which help improve a website\'s user
experience and usability. Users trust search engines. Having a presence

There are additional benefits of using SEO. SEO is essential for the
social promotion of a website. People who find a website through a
Google or Bing search are more likely to share it on Facebook, Twitter,
or other social media platforms. SEO enables the smooth operation of a
large website. Websites with multiple authors can benefit from SEO
directly and indirectly. The direct benefit is increased organic
traffic, and the indirect benefit is a common structure or checklist to
utilize before publishing content on the website. SEO can help get a
competitive edge. If two websites sell the same product, the
search-engine-optimized website will have more customers and make more
sales.

# 12. SEO Strategies {#seo-strategies .unnumbered}

Welcome to SEO Strategies.

After watching this video, you will be able to:

-   define an SEO strategy

-   and define the steps to develop an SEO strategy.

An SEO strategy is a plan of action for a company to optimize its
website and rank high in Google search results. It\'s a combination of
layered on-page, off-page, and technical SEO tactics designed to boost
rankings for primary and secondary keywords, pages, and websites.
Knowing what works best for you and your business, as well as connecting
with your ideal audience, is an important part of developing an SEO
strategy. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to developing an SEO
strategy, as it greatly depends on the website, content, and audience.
However, some useful points should be considered before developing an
SEO strategy to make your website more searchable online. These include:
Assessing the current SEO strategy, Analyzing the competition, Setting
goals and KPIs, Executing the improved strategy, and Monitoring the
execution.

The first step is to evaluate your current SEO strategy and its
performance. You should assess your website\'s organic visibility,
keyword rankings, and branded vs. non-branded traffic split.

There are several tools available online to show you this information.
You can use them to track the performance of your website's organic
traffic and keyword rankings over time. You can also easily spot trends
and gather detailed information on all aspects of the business to
maximize sales and profits by conducting business research. Customer
research will reveal how current customers perceive your company and
will allow you to create detailed purchasing behavior profiles.
Understanding the difference between branded and non-branded traffic on
your website will help you identify opportunities. Increasing
non-branded traffic allows you to acquire new users who may not have
previously heard of you. You\'ll also be able to identify areas that
need improvement for your next SEO strategy. After you\'ve assessed your
current SEO strategy, you should analyze the competitors\' SEO
strategies. This will give you a sense of what is and isn\'t working for
them, as well as areas where you can capitalize to gain an advantage.
Begin by compiling a list of your main competitors, which should include
those in your service area and the ones who consistently rank high in
the SERPs for your main keywords. Next, you need to determine which of
their pages receive the most traffic. This can help you decide what type
of content should be added to your website to improve your ranking. Keep
track of whether the competitors' best-performing pages are blogs,
product pages, or other pages. Then, you need to identify how well their
keywords rank. Analyzing their keyword rankings will tell you if your
competitors are ranked for keywords that you are not. This will help you
identify opportunities to boost your keyword rankings. Finally, you need
to analyze the link profiles of your competitors\' websites. This will
help you understand where their backlinks are coming from and identify
the link gap between their website and yours. This will enable you to
develop your link-building strategy to build a strong backlink profile.

After your strategy is developed, you need to set goals you want to
achieve. Like: What aspects of the company do you want to improve? and
Is there more traffic? How about more clicks or perhaps more down-funnel
activity?

Addressing these questions will help you consider what readers might be
looking for that would persuade them to visit or interact with your
website.

Keeping these metrics in mind throughout the development of your
business strategy will allow you to track your progress in real-time.
Each goal should be mapped to a unique tactic that you can employ to
help optimize your strategy, which is why knowing your goals ahead of
time is crucial.

After your goals are set, you should begin optimizing your website for
positive page experience. Begin by brainstorming potential keywords and
researching competitors using the Google AdWords keyword tool. Remember
that meta tags are still useful in SEO.

Google considers the title and description of your page to be an
indication of keyword relevance. You will be able to effectively rank
your keywords while also providing a positive user experience if you
create high-quality content.

Next, on a monthly or bimonthly basis, you should submit press releases
on any company initiatives and contact popular blogs in your niche to
see how you can collaborate to get a backlink from their website.

Many content websites are focused primarily on community. As a result,
you should cultivate a strong social media presence that sends signals
of authority and influence to search engines. Finally, note that when
customers search for products online, they frequently look at both web
and image results. If you have high-quality product images on your
website and include relevant keywords in the file names, the images will
rank higher in search engines. Finally, you need to be on the lookout
for new trends and best practices. Some of these include:

Optimizing for entities (not keywords) -- Focus on building pages around
topics and including topic variants. Focusing on user engagement
signals, particularly speed. Prioritizing indexing and crawling -- The
number of pages indexed is increasing exponentially, and Google is
shifting from indexing everything to indexing quality content. Link
building -- Focus on gaining authoritative links that your competitors
do not already have. Analyzing your metrics and making actionable
experiments based on your findings. In this video, you learned that: SEO
strategy assists in website optimization and ranking high in search
results, and there are five tips to consider when developing an SEO
strategy: plan and assess the current SEO strategy and performance,
analyze competitor's SEO strategies to capitalize on and gain an
advantage, consider and set the types of goals to achieve, execute
strategies and optimize the website for a positive experience, and
finally, monitor and be on the lookout for new trends and best
practices.

# 13. Mobile Friendly SEO {#mobile-friendly-seo .unnumbered}

Welcome to "Mobile friendly SEO."

After watching this video, you will be able to:

-   define mobile SEO and its importance,

-   differentiate between mobile and desktop SEO,

-   describe how to check if a website is mobile friendly,

-   and identify the best practices.

Mobile SEO is the process of optimizing websites for mobile devices such
as smartphones and tablets. This includes optimizing the
website\'s  design and content, as well as making the website resources
available to search engine spiders. Mobile SEO considers:

How a user interacts with search engine results (SERPs) on a mobile
device versus a desktop computer. The differences in intent between
desktop and mobile for the same query. If the pages load quickly and do
not contain data-sapping resources, such as bloated images and extra
script, and How to include usability best practices for mobile content
access and provide the best visual experience Due to significant
increase in mobile usage, most users access a website through a mobile
device rather than a desktop. This makes mobile SEO important because it
allows  you to reach your customers at the right time and provide them
with the best possible experience. According to studies, people
frequently use the nearest device to look something up quickly, which is
usually their smartphone. They use it to research products before making
purchases. According to Google research, smartphone users are more
likely to purchase than desktop users. It is your responsibility to be
available when they are looking for your products or services. Let's now
discuss the significant differences between desktop and mobile SEO.
Location - Desktop SEO focuses on the general public, with no geographic
restrictions. While most mobile users are looking for local results,
mobile SEO is typically focused on local searches. Operating system -
Depending on the  device you are using; different results may appear for
the same search query. This is because Google considers the mobile
device\'s operating system when displaying the most relevant search
results.

When the keyword has a strong app-oriented intent, search engines
display app packs that are compatible with the device. Screen size - The
differences in search layout for desktop and mobile due to screen space
can also affect how people view your website. Because mobile device
screens are vertical and much smaller than desktop screens, search
results have a fraction of the search space that a desktop screen has.
The best tool to use to determine whether your website is
mobile-friendly is Google Search Console. Its search tools are extremely
useful if you want to know how your website ranks in search results. For
example, you can see how mobile and desktop users use keywords to find
what they need by using the Search Analytics feature. Googlebot must be
able to crawl your JavaScript, CSS, and image files in order to properly
index them. URL Inspection is a useful tool in Search Console for this.
By using this tool, you can see how Googlebot interprets and displays
your content. The Mobile Usability tool is another Google Search Console
feature that scans your site and displays a list of posts and pages that
do not adhere to Google\'s mobile-friendly guidelines.

Other excellent mobile SEO tools include Google\'s Mobile-Friendly Test
& Analytics, SEMrush, Ahrefs, ScreamingFrog, and SimilarWeb.

If your site is already well optimized for search engines, there are
only a few things to consider when optimizing for mobile devices. They
are as follows: Page speed - Because of hardware and connectivity
issues, mobile users value page speed even more than desktop users.
Aside from optimizing images, you should also minify code, use browser
caching, and reduce redirects. CSS, JavaScript, or image blocking - The
Smartphone Googlebot wishes to be able to see and categorize the same
content as humans. So don\'t try to hide these elements. They are also
important in determining whether you have a responsive site or a
different mobile solution.

Avoid Popups and Flash - The plugin may not be available on your user\'s
phone, causing them to miss out on all the fun. Use HTML5 instead if you
want to create special effects. Design for Touch screen - Touch screen
navigation can result in accidental clicks if your buttons are too big,
too small, or in the path of a finger attempting to scroll the page.
Optimize titles and meta descriptions - Keep in

mind that when a user searches on a mobile device, you have less screen
space to work with. Be concise when creating titles, URLs, and Meta
descriptions to showcase your best work in SERPS. Optimize for local
search - If your business has a local element, make sure your mobile
content is optimized for local search. This includes standardizing your
name, address, and phone number, as well as including your city and
state name in the metadata of your website. Mobile site configuration -
Choosing whether to use a responsive, dynamic serving, or separate site
configuration is an important decision when setting up a site. Google
prefers responsive design, but all three options are acceptable as long
as they are properly configured. Finally, create a separate mobile URL -
Another option is to create a separate site for mobile users. This
enables you to create entirely unique content for mobile visitors. In
this video, you learned that:

Mobile SEO is the process of optimizing websites for mobile devices such
as smartphones and tablets. It enables websites to reach customers at
the ideal times and locations to give them the best experiences.

The best tool for determining whether a website is mobile-friendly is
Google Search Console, and creating a mobile-specific website allows you
to create content that is completely unique for mobile viewers.

# 14. Page Optimization for SEO {#page-optimization-for-seo .unnumbered}

Welcome to "Page optimization for SEO."

After finishing this section, you will be able to:

-   Define on-page SEO and list its importance,

-   and Identify the various on-page SEO components.

Page Optimization for SEO, also known as on-page SEO or on-site SEO, is
the process of improving a website\'s ranking and visibility in search
engines by optimizing various front-end and back-end components such as
page speed, keyword density, and external backlinks. Search engines like
Google use keywords and other on-page SEO cues to determine whether a
page matches a user\'s search intent. The better a search engine
understands a website\'s content, the higher it will rank in the search
results, resulting in a more organic traffic, conversions, and revenue.
On-page SEO aims to make it easy for both search engines and users to:
Understand the purpose of a website. Determine whether the page is
relevant to one or more search queries. Identify whether the page is
useful enough to rank higher on a SERP, and Assist in website
optimization by informing Google about how the website adds value to
visitors and customers. Text and HTML changes are required to optimize a
website page fully. The following are the key components of on-page SEO.
Content elements, HTML elements which include: Page Titles, Headers,
Meta Descriptions, Image Alt-text, and Structured Markup. And Site
structure elements which include: Page URLs, Internal Linking, Mobile
Responsiveness, and Site Speed. Let's explore each in detail. The first
type of on-page SEO component that we are going to discuss is Content
elements. Content elements are the elements of your website\'s copy and
content. It provides information about your website and

business to both search engines and readers. Let\'s consider some
guidelines for creating high-quality page content. Use short and
long-tail keywords naturally Include visually appealing and relevant
content. Create content for your specific buyer persona(s). Make content
that people will want to share and link to. Create brief, compelling
introductions. Clearly articulate both the problem and your solution.
Avoid using lengthy sentences and paragraphs. However, if you eliminate
paragraphs entirely, your content will not flow properly. Break up
sections that are longer than 300 words using subheadings. Naturally
incorporate the target SEO keyword throughout the page copy. Match
content to search intent, and Always write with your readers in mind.
Another type of on-page SEO component is HTML elements. It refers to the
elements in your source code. Let's discuss each of them in detail. One
of the most important SEO elements are your web page titles, also known
as title tags. Titles inform both visitors and search engines about what
is available on the corresponding pages. Make sure to include the focus
keyword for each page in the title to ensure your site pages rank for
the correct intent. The HTML elements h1, h2, till h6 are referred to as
headers, also known as body tags. These tags help web developers
organize content for readers, and search engines determine which parts
of your content are the most important and relevant based on search
intent. Include important keywords in your headers, but not the same
ones as in your page title. In your h1 and h2 headers, include your most
important keywords. Meta descriptions are the short page descriptions
that appear beneath the title in search results. It can influence
whether or not users click on your page. When your content is shared on
social media, meta descriptions can be copied over to encourage
click-throughs from there as well. Image alt-text is similar to SEO for
images. It informs Google and other search engines about the content of
the images, which is important because Google now delivers nearly as
many image-based results as text-based results. Structured markup, also
known as structured data, is the process of \"marking up\" a website's
source code so that Google can easily find and understand different
elements of the content. Structured markup is responsible for the
featured snippets, knowledge panels, and other content features that
appear when you search for something on Google. The last type of on-page
SEO component is Site structure elements. It refers to the components of
your website and site pages. Let's discuss each of them in detail. Your
page URLs should be easy to remember

for both readers and search engines. They are also important for
maintaining the consistency of your site hierarchy as you create
subpages, blog posts, and other types of internal pages. The process of
hyperlinking to other useful pages on your website is known as internal
linking. Internal linking is important for on-page SEO because it
directs readers to other pages on your website, which keeps them on your
site longer and tells Google that your site is valuable and helpful.
Besides that, the more time visitors spend on your website, the more
time Google has to crawl and index your site pages. This allows Google
to learn more about your website and potentially rank it higher in
search engine results pages. Mobile responsiveness is important. Sites
that are optimized for faster mobile speeds are now given preference by
Google. It is critical to select a mobile-friendly website hosting
service, website design and theme, and content layout. Your site must
load quickly, whether viewed on a mobile device or a desktop computer.
On-page SEO relies heavily on page speed. Google is concerned with the
user experience first and foremost. Visitors are unlikely to stick
around if your site loads slowly or haphazardly. Moreover, site speed
has an impact on conversions and ROI. In this video, you learned that:
On-page SEO is the process of improving a website\'s ranking and
visibility in search engines. It helps Google understand website content
for higher ranking in search results. The key components of on-site SEO
are: Content Elements, HTML Elements, and Site Structural Optimization
Content elements are the elements of your website\'s copy and content.
HTML elements are the elements of your source code, and Site structure
elements are components of the website.

# 15. Running Campaigns and Tracking Results {#running-campaigns-and-tracking-results .unnumbered}

Welcome to "Running Campaigns and Tracking Results."

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   define SEO campaign and SEO tracking,

-   explain the best practices for running an SEO campaign,

-   and identify the key SEO tracking tools.

An SEO campaign is a planned effort to raise a website\'s ranking in
search results. This includes optimizing webpages for specific keywords,
creating quality content, building backlinks, and promoting the site via
social media. Keywords help in the discovery of relevant content on your
website and are used to predict how much traffic you will receive from
search engines. Regularly updating your website informs search engines
that you are active and helps boost your website. Backlinks are external
links that direct to your website. When someone shares a link to your
website, search engines learn that you have interesting content. Social
media platforms are excellent for promoting your content. People enjoy
sharing interesting articles and videos, so this is a great way to reach
many people. SEO tracking is the process of assessing the effectiveness
and development of a campaign. This step is used to establish specific
and measurable campaign goals. Here are some of the key metrics. Organic
Traffic: One of the best indicators of an SEO campaign\'s effectiveness
is the amount of organic traffic it generates for a website. Organic
Conversions: One of the most effective ways to assess the quality of
organic traffic is to track the number of conversions it generates. To
track conversions and the conversion rate from organic traffic, create a
relevant \"Goal\" in Google Analytics. Keyword Rankings: Daily keyword
tracking is an excellent way to stay on top of the overall direction of
the SEO efforts and also provides a clear snapshot of which pages can be
improved. Competitor Analysis: You can identify new opportunities to
rank your own website by tracking the keywords your competitors are
ranking for, their domain authority, and other SEO metrics. SEO Site
Health: One important ranking factor is the site\'s SEO friendliness,
which includes having a way to identify and address common technical
problems. When you use SEO in your content, you can increase organic
traffic to your website. There are a few best practices that can assist
you in running an SEO campaign smoothly. They are as follows:

Monitoring website traffic, Tracking content's effectiveness, Tracking
top-performing pages, and Monitoring paid campaigns. Monitoring website
traffic can help you make quick decisions and gain immediate insights.
Unusual spikes or drops, for example, can be caused by website bugs or
changes to the code in a recent update. Keeping an eye on these numbers
daily allows you to quickly identify and address such issues. SEO\'s
primary function is to increase visibility in search results and direct
visitors to the website. Analyzing search engines as a traffic source
can provide the data required to build an image of a customer\'s
behavior and intent. Knowing your overall traffic and which pages are
being visited will assist you in developing new content and optimizing
what you already have. It\'s handy to have all of the data about
individual page performance in one place. Entries and time on a page
indicate how engaging your content is, while bounce rate indicates
whether users continue browsing your site or leave. When it comes to
paid campaigns, ensuring that your budget is spent strategically
requires real-time feedback that provides clear results and insights.
Tagging campaign URLs correctly is a sure way to avoid cluttered reports
and keep incoming visitors organized. Now that you know the best
practices for running an SEO campaign, here are two key SEO tracking
tools to help you manage and track the results of your website.

They are:

Google Analytics and Google Search Console. Google Analytics can be
viewed as an SEO tracking tool for everything that happens after someone
visits your website. This includes SEO metrics such as time on site,
bounce rate, and exit rate, among others. Setting up Goals in Google
Analytics allows you to track important website events such as
purchases, email signups, trial signups, and any other event you want to
track. There are four types of custom goals to consider when creating
one: Destination: This goal considers a page view or screen view to be a
conversion. Duration: This metric measures user engagement by
considering a conversion to be the minimum session duration.
Pages/screens per session: This metric assesses user engagement by
identifying conversions as users who view more than a set number of
pages or screens per session. Event: This classifies a specific user
interaction with your website or app as a conversion. Google Search
Console (GSC) is another free tool that lets you monitor your site\'s
search traffic and performance, troubleshoot problems, and optimize it
for search results. The platform monitors SEO metrics such as:

Top Queries: It consists of the most popular search terms that drive
traffic to a website. Top Pages: It lists the pages with the highest
impressions and clicks so that you know which ones to prioritize when it
comes to optimizing the user experience. CTR (Click-Through-Rate):
Another useful metric to track over time because it frequently allows
you to identify \"quick wins\" by simply changing the title or meta
description, resulting in a significant increase in traffic.

In this section, you learned that:

-   SEO campaign is a strategic effort to improve a website\'s ranking
    in search results.

-   SEO tracking is the process of assessing the effectiveness and
    development of a campaign.

-   Monitoring website traffic helps in making quick decisions and
    gaining immediate insights,

-   Google Analytics keeps track of everything that happens after a user
    visits a website,

-   and Google Search Console monitors website\'s search traffic and
    performance, troubleshoots problems, and optimizes search results.

# 16. Do's and Don'ts of Search Engine Optimization {#dos-and-donts-of-search-engine-optimization .unnumbered}

some practices become obsolete or even unacceptable over time. The

# 17. Introduction to Web Build and Automated Tools {#introduction-to-web-build-and-automated-tools .unnumbered}

Welcome to \"Introduction to Web Build and Automated Tools."

After watching this video, you will be able to:

-   define build automation,

-   identify the benefits of build automation,

-   discuss the use of automated web build tools and bundlers in a given
    situation,

-   and describe some popular web build tools and bundlers.

Build automation is the process of preparing the source code for
production so that users can interact with it comfortably. It could
include compilation, database schema updates, creating an installer or
executable file, etc. Automation helps to standardize builds, speed them
up, and minimize mistakes done manually. It is a process where
retrieving the source code is automated, the code is compiled into
binary code, automated tests are executed, and the code is published
into a shared, centralized repository. Build automation is essential for
Continuous Integration (CI) to take place. Continuous Integration is a
practice that a developer follows to integrate code into a shared
repository multiple times in a period. The integration is then verified
by an automated build and automated tests. Due to this regular
integration, errors are identified quickly and easily. Suppose you have
a 300-line JavaScript script. You simply insert the old script tag into
your page. We start adding more functionality to the page, and before
you know it, your single script file contains 10000 lines of code. It
becomes difficult to manage all that amount of code with multiple people
working on the same file. A natural solution is that you split the code
in multiple scripts with different script tags. You have to put the
smaller files in a particular order to ensure that the utility function
is available. This is not an ideal situation if you need to keep making
changes in the same file to ensure that the order remains unchanged. We
can link all our files in a single script tag but will still need to
monitor the code updates and the order of the existing and additional
files. Simply concatenating all the files in the right order would not
be enough. A better strategy would be each file to indicate which other
file it needs (its dependencies), which is a point at which we could
incorporate that mapping into our previous concatenation strategy. At
this point, the functionality of an automated build tool and bundler
comes into prominence. Let\'s quickly go through the functions of
JavaScript tools. Using these build tools, your JavaScript and
dependencies are prepared for use in a browser. Some of the functions
include transformation, bundling, minification, and serving.
Transformation translates various forms of JavaScript/TypeScript (and
additional assets like HTML, CSS, and images) into browser-compatible,
standard packages. Bundling implies compiling multiple source components
into a few browser-friendly JavaScript bundles. Certain build tools
launched recently can avoid this step to enhance performance.
Minification reduces the size of the JavaScript bundle by eliminating
redundant code, renaming variables, and adopting a variety of other
optimization approaches. Serving provides the content to browsers in
development mode, including the feature like "hot" reloading. Note that
not all tools do all these steps or do them in exactly the same way.
However, these are some of the core problems that most build tools
address in one way or another. Build automation offers five main
benefits. These include increased productivity, accelerated delivery,
enhanced quality, record maintenance, and saving time and money. Let's
discuss each of these benefits in detail. One of the major benefits of
build automation is increased productivity. Build automation leads to
quick feedback. This means that developers spend less time dealing with
tools or processes and invest more time in delivering value. Another
benefit of build automation is accelerated delivery. Build automation
eradicates unnecessary tasks and enables you to identify issues faster,
which helps expedite the delivery process. Enhanced quality is another
important benefit of build automation. Build automation helps prevent
bad builds by enabling you to identify and address issues faster. This
results in enhanced quality of your product. Furthermore, it records
maintenance. Build automation enables you to maintain a complete history
of files and changes made. Maintaining a complete history enables you to
track issues back to their core. The last benefit we will discuss in
this session is saving time and money. As build automation ensures
increased productivity, accelerated delivery, and enhanced quality, it
enables you to save time and money spent in delivering quality products
and services. Now, we will explore some popular web build tools and
bundlers. These include: Grunt, Gulp, Browserify, Webpack, npm, and
RequireJS. Let's take a brief look at each of these tools. Grunt is the
first well-known task runner for front-end developers. Its popularity
was aided by the plugin architecture. As plugins are often complex, it
might be challenging to comprehend what is happening whenever
configuration increases.

Gulp is another JavaScript task runner built on Node streams. What
differentiates Gulp from others is that the former uses Node streams,
which means piping the output derived from one task as an input for the
next. Unlike Grunt, It deals with actual code rather than relying on
plugin configuration. Browserify is a build tool that allows using
Node.js modules directly in a browser. It allows you to bundle all your
JavaScript modules into one file that can be referenced within a script
tag. It can be connected to Gulp, and there are smaller transformation
tools available that let you go beyond the fundamental uses. The
Browserify ecosystem is composed of a lot of small modules. Webpack
offers a core that provides more functionalities straight out of the box
compared to Browserify\'s collection of several little tools. Therefore,
it is claimed that Webpack offers a clearer strategy compared to
Browserify. Webpack core can also be extended using specific loaders and
plugins. It provides flexibility in resolving modules and enables you to
modify your build to suit certain circumstances and get around packages
that don\'t function properly in difficult situations. Node package
manager (npm) functions as a package manager for JavaScript. It serves
as the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment,
also called node.js. It consists of a command line client and an online
database of both free and paid private packages. Users can use this tool
to download and share JavaScript modules stored in the registry.
Packages are kept in the common JS format and have JSON-formatted
metadata files in the npm registry. Both the packages installed globally
and the local dependencies of specific objects can be managed by npm.
RequireJS is a JavaScript library and file loader that manages the
dependencies between JavaScript files and modular programming. It
enhances both the speed and quality. RequireJS offers asynchronous
module loading and the ability to load layered dependencies. For a
better user experience, it merges and minifies modules into a single
script. It can compile JavaScript files from many modules and
load several JavaScript files. In this video, you learned about: build
automation and its process, the use of automated web build tools and
bundlers in a given situation, some important functions of build
JavaScript tools, the five main benefits of Build automation, and some
popular web build tools and bundlers used in web development.

# 18. Introduction to Webpack 5 {#introduction-to-webpack-5 .unnumbered}

Welcome to the "Introduction to Webpack 5." After watching this video,
you will be able to: describe Webpack 5, explain some advantages of
Webpack 5, explain the functions of Webpack 5, explain how Webpack 5
works, and describe why to use Webpack 5. Webpack 5 is a module bundler
that assists, in handling the bundling of assets, modules, and
dependencies into a single bundle while allowing developers to
concentrate on the development. Instead of being dependent on online
solutions, you can use Webpack 5 to build your own custom solutions or
boilerplates.

Now that you understand what Webpack 5 is, let us see some of its
advantages. Webpack 5 has the following advantages:

It neatly bundles your code. It enables you to write the most recent
JavaScript code using Babel or TypeScript and compiles it for
cross-browser compatibility, and then cleanly minifies it.

It allows the import of static assets into your JavaScript, and Also
offers a development server for development, which can instantly update
modules and styles as you save.

Now that you understand what Webpack 5 is and its advantages, let us
discuss what it does.

Webpack 5:

-   Helps assemble your resources,

-   Keeps track of modifications and reruns tasks,

-   Converts inline images into data URIs,

-   Uses require () for CSS files,

-   Runs a development web server,

-   and Supports live updates or hot module replacement during
    development.

Webpack 5 is a command line tool and essentially a module bundler that
unifies all sources and module types to import everything in the
JavaScript code, resulting in a transferable output. It does so by
taking multiple files and combining them into one big file, as shown
here. The output file that Webpack generates can be sent to the client's
browser by a server.

We will now explore the benefits of using Webpack 5. Webpack 5 is
powerful and has unique plugin system. Its latest features have overcome
flaws and shortcomings evident in its predecessors. It allows you to
bundle JavaScript files even without a configuration file.

Webpack 5 regulates different application entry points or parts and
offers shared bundles between them. Additional distinct bundle for each
portion can be loaded. Webpack 5 converts static assets into build
bundles and generates them for development and consistency. It is simple
to cache assets as Webpack 5 allows each file\'s assets to have their
own version.

In this section, you learned that:

-   Webpack 5 is a command line tool that assists in handling the
    bundling of assets, modules, and dependencies into a single bundle.

-   There are several advantages of using Webpack 5

-   Numerous functions can be performed by Webpack 5.

-   Webpack 5 works by taking multiple files and combining them into one
    big file. It is powerful and has a unique plugin system as well as
    numerous other benefits.

# 19. Essential Concepts of Webpack {#essential-concepts-of-webpack .unnumbered}

Welcome to "Essentials Concepts of Webpack"

After watching this video, you will be able to:

-   Explain the four core concepts of Webpack

-   Define components that optimize the functioning of Webpack

Let us start by discussing Webpack's role in combining modules into
bundles. Webpack is a module bundler and allows you to create codes in
modules. If one file is dependent on another, it is treated as a
dependency by Webpack. The initial configuration starts from a single
module. It then processes all its dependencies, which can be either
direct or indirect. This gives shape to a dependency graph on which it
will bundle all the webpack modules. Considering this, we will learn the
core concepts in detail. They are: Entry Output Loaders and Plugins In
addition, we will touch upon some components related to Webpack. The
first concept is Entry. The initial point from which the frontend
project\'s dependencies are gathered is known as an entry point. This is
a basic JavaScript file. These dependencies then create a dependency
graph. The default entry point for Webpack is src/index.js, and it is
configurable. Webpack can have multiple entry points that produce
modules through each dependency, and it repeats this procedure
throughout the application. Here is an example. The second concept is
Output. The static and JavaScript files produced by the build process
are gathered in Output. The default output folder for Webpack is webpack
dist/. and it can also be customized. The output configuration tells
Webpack how and where it should put the bundles. In this example, you
are instructing Webpack to place the bundles in a JavaScript file called
My-Webpack.bundle.js in the same directory as Webpack.config.js. Let us
now understand the third concept, Loader. As Webpack only understands
JavaScript and JSON files, Loaders are used to process other types of
files and convert them into valid modules. They transform the source
code of non-JavaScript modules, allowing us to preprocess those files
before they're added to the dependency graph. They help Webpack deal
with various file extensions. Let us look at an example.

The last concept is Plugins. It allows Webpack to perform a wide range
of tasks like bundle optimization, asset management, injection of
environment variables, and minifying files. They are third-party
extensions that can alter how Webpack functions. For example, there are
plugins for extracting HTML and CSS or setting up environment variables.
Along with these, there are some additional concepts that optimize the
functioning of Webpack. Let us briefly touch upon them. Chunk refers to
the code extracted from modules. They are commonly used when performing
code-splitting with Webpack. Assets refer to the static files bundled
during the build process. These can be in the form of images, fonts, or
even videos. Webpack supports a configuration file for projects with
complex structures. This is more efficient than having to type in a lot
of commands in the terminal manually. Bundles separate the source code
from the distribution code. The source code is what we write and edit,
whereas the distribution code is the optimized output that is finally
loaded in the browser.

In this section, you learned that:

-   Webpack is a module bundler and depends on the dependency graph.

-   Entry point for Webpack is the initial point for creating dependency
    graphs.

-   Static and JavaScript files produced by the build process are
    collected in the output.

-   Loaders transform other file extensions to JavaScript and JSON
    files.

-   Plugins allow Webpack to perform a wide range of tasks.

# 20. Working with Webpack {#working-with-webpack .unnumbered}

Welcome to "Working with Webpack."

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   explain the importance of Webpack configuration,

-   identify how assets are handled in a configuration file,

-   discuss code splitting and the three ways to accomplish it,

-   explain Preload and Prefetch for resource navigation,

-   and describe the three main Webpack modes.

Let's first understand the functions of Webpack and why we need
configuration. Webpack is a module bundler for web applications that
bundles, minifies, and transpiles JavaScript code to a browser-friendly
code. Webpack assumes that your code begins at src/index.js and will be
bundled to dist/main.js by default. Configuration helps to determine
whether code should be compressed for quicker execution or packed with
source maps for better error tracking. Webpack supports a configuration
file for projects with complex structures. This is more efficient than
manually typing numerous commands in the terminal. You can see a sample
config file on the screen.

The configuration JavaScript module belongs to CommonJS. Output from
this file is an object that Webpack will consider. The configuration
mentioned above instructs Webpack to create the project in development
mode to include comments and non-minimized code in the output bundle
while it is running. Let's learn how assets can be easily managed using
Webpack Your project will often contain assets such as images, fonts,
icons, and other assets. In Webpack 4, we had to install one or more
loaders to work with assets. This is not needed in Webpack 5 because the

new version comes with built-in asset modules. They allow you to use
asset files without configuring additional loaders. Let's now explore
how each asset type is handled in the Webpack configuration file. A CSS
file can be imported by installing and adding the style-loader and CSS
loader to your module configuration. Images and icons can be
incorporated using built-in asset modules. The asset modules can
incorporate any font through your build directory. Data can be
incorporated in the form of JSON files, CSVs, TSVs, and XML Now that you
have learned about asset management, let's understand code splitting.
The code splitting feature in Webpack is used to achieve smaller bundles
and control resource load prioritization. The reduced main bundle size
will speed up the initial load time and enable the users to engage with
your application more quickly. Code Splitting in Webpack 5 can be
accomplished in three ways: Entry points: Manually split code
using entry configuration. Prevent duplication: Remove identical entries
and split chunks with SplitChunksPlugin. Dynamic imports: Split code
using inline function calls within modules. Now that you have a clear
understanding of code splitting let's learn about Preload and Prefetch.
Preload is a declarative request that enables you to instruct the
browser to request a resource without interrupting the document's onload
event. These are the modules needed for current navigation and are
loaded in parallel to the parent chunk. Prefetch serves as an indication
to the browser that a resource may be required, but it leaves it to the
browser to determine if it is to be loaded or not. These are the modules
needed for future navigation. They start loading after the parent chunk
finishes loading. Developers must be careful when employing it since
improper configuration might result in poor performance. Lastly, let's
identify the three main configuration modes for Webpack. A mode
configuration option instructs Webpack to make appropriate use of its
built-in optimizations. The three main configuration modes are:
Development Production And none Development mode is used specifically in
the development phase of an application. Webpack offers source maps in
the development code that link your produced code to the original source
code. This makes debugging simpler and speeds up the process of fixing
bugs and errors in your code. Production is the default mode value and
is used to deliver the final code for production. Webpack, in production
mode, tries its best to optimize the build by automatically minifying
the code with the help of TerserPlugin. It encourages Webpack to give
you access to all the optimizations possible, such as tree shaking,
performance hints, or minification with the TerserWebpackPlugin. It is
helpful at the time of building an application. In this mode, none of
the default optimization options are applied. In this video, you learned
about: Webpack and its role as a module bundler for web applications,
Webpack configuration and its importance, asset management and how
assets are handled in a configuration file, code splitting and the three
ways to accomplish it, the functions of Preload and Prefetch, and the
three main configuration modes for Webpack.

# 21. Setting up Production with Webpack {#setting-up-production-with-webpack .unnumbered}

Welcome to "Setting up Production with Webpack."

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   identify the different configuration modes in Webpack

-   and discuss the best practices related to Webpack in production.

A mode configuration option instructs Webpack to make appropriate use of
its built-in optimizations. You can set it to \"none\" to disable any
default behavior. There are two main configuration options for Webpack:
the development and production modes. The development mode simplifies
debugging by activating NamedChunksPlugin and preventing minification,
among other things. In development mode, the bundle will be descriptive
and will include more comments. As a result of Webpack\'s adoption of
the software engineering paradigm convention over configuration, you can
basically acquire a useful configuration by simply setting the mode to
production. Production is the default mode value. It encourages Webpack
to give you access to all the optimizations possible, such as tree
shaking, performance hints, or minification with the
TerserWebpackPlugin. It is really helpful at the time of building an
application. Webpack, in production mode, tries its best to optimize the
build by automatically minifying the code. It is recommended to create
distinct Webpack settings for each scenario. Development and production
builds have numerous different objectives. In the case of development,
the goal is to have strong source mapping and a local host server with
live reloading or hot module replacement. In the case of production, the
goal shifts to minified bundles, lighter-weight source maps, and
optimized assets to improve the load time. We still prefer a "common"
configuration to make things uniform. We will now discuss the best
practices related to Webpack in production. Webpack, in the production
mode, tries its best to optimize the build by automatically minifying
the code. Some of the best production practices to improve a website's
performance include: Minifying CSS, Webpack source maps, File hashing,
and Cleanup of old assets. Let's discuss each of these practices in
detail. Minifying CSS means to remove unnecessary characters, such as
comments, whitespaces, and indentation. Minifying your assets in
production is a good practice as it can drastically improve the
website's load time. Here are the steps to minify CSS: Add another
plugin to help Webpack minify your CSS files. Open your command line.
Run npm install optimize-css-assets-Webpack-plugin. Finally, save dev.
Source maps are generated alongside built files, which are minified
already. These maps let you trace back the minified code to its original
location and help in debugging the code live. Webpack has built-in
support for source map generation via the devtool property. Files
essentially consist of data chunks. This data is changed via hashing
into a key or value that is much shorter and fixed in length. It is
called file hashing. It is important as it allows making changes in a
file even after the website is published. Adding hashing or content
hashing is known as long-term caching, as the files could be cached
forever. One of the best practices related to production is to install a
plugin to create a build folder and to clean that folder every time it
runs. This is done to avoid the minification of all the files in the
public folder. To install a cleanup plugin, follow these steps: Install
a plugin. Open your command line and run npm install
clean-Webpack-plugin. Finally, save dev.

In this section, you learned that:

-   Webpack in production mode allows many practices that are helpful at
    the time of building an application.

-   These include: Minifying CSS to remove unnecessary characters, such
    as comments, whitespaces, and indentation.

-   Generating source maps to trace back the minified code to its
    original location.

-   File hashing to make changes in a file even after a website is
    published.

-   Clean up old assets to avoid the minification of all the files in
    the public folder.

# 22. Using Webpack Tools {#using-webpack-tools .unnumbered}

Welcome to "Using Webpack Tools."

After watching this video, you will be able to:

-   Explain the need for Webpack tools,

-   and Describe five popular Webpack bundle size tools.

Webpack is a module bundler used to bundle JavaScript files to be used
in a browser. Bundle size is an important metric determining how fast a
web application will load. Growth in applications results in large
bundle sizes, creating a problem for the developers. An increase in
bundle size results in an increase in download time and a bigger
overhead in execution time during initialization. Let's now discuss the
benefits of  reducing the build size. Reduced build size leads to the
website loading quickly. JavaScript execution and processing   will be
quicker, which is essential in the case of mobile applications.
Ultimately, the user\'s mobile data plan cost is reduced. Developers use
different Webpack tools to reduce the bundle size. Let's explore five
such tools.

The five popular Webpack tools that we are going to explore in this
session include:

Bundlephobia, Webpack Visualizer, Webpack Analyzer, Source Map Explorer,
and Webpack Bundle Analyzer.

Now, let's discuss each in detail.

One of the most popular Webpack tool  that developers use is
Bundlephobia. It is a build-size tool that can be used as a website or
plugin. It offers various benefits. Bundlephobia enables you to
understand the performance cost of installing a new NPM package before
it becomes a part of your bundle. It evaluates the package size
beforehand and helps select the best option available. Bundlephobia also
displays how this package will affect users and browsers when it is used
in your application. For example, it helps determine the download and
render times. To use Bundlephobia as a website, upload the package.json
file to the website. It will give you all the details, including the
file size, download time, dependency information, and statistics for
various plugin versions. To use Bundlephobia as a plugin, install it
with NPM and install the -g bundle-phobia-cli command. Another popular
Webpack tool is Webpack Visualizer. It is an analysis tool used to
create a visual representation of your final bundle. This tool also
detects modules used in our project and offers insights into which
modules can be duplicated. It shows the visualized separation of
components. It determines how much space they take up and their
percentage allocation to the overall amount of the chunk. There are two
ways of using Webpack Visualizer. You can upload your stats.json file on
chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer. Or you could just install it
using npm webpack-visualizer-plugin and then import it to the webpack
config file. The next popular Webpack tool we will explore is Webpack
Analyzer. It is an interactive tool that helps you visualize your bundle
sizes. Webpack Analyzer offers a more detailed examination of your
bundle by generating a dependency graph. Webpack Analyzer results
display the warnings and errors from the Webpack build with suggestions
on how to enhance it. To use Webpack Analyzer, generate a stat file
using the Webpack --- profile --- json \> stats.json command and upload
it to the website. Source Map Explorer is another popular Webpack tool
that offers a visual representation of any JavaScript bundle that has a
source map. It informs you about the file size of the
minified JavaScript bundle and helps you identify the origin of the
minified code. Source Map Explorer allows you to inspect your final
bundle in a graphical manner. It provides a treemap visualization to
help you debug where all the code is coming from. To use Source Map
Explorer: Install Source Map Explorer globally using npm. Then, try to
generate a responsive treemap of your bundle using
the bundle.js and bundle.js.map files. The last Webpack tool we will
explore is Webpack Bundle Analyzer. It provides guidance on which
modules may be trimmed and helps identify modules used in your project.
It also supports minified bundles. Webpack bundle Analyzer helps to
identify modules that are large or can be removed. To use this tool:
Install the plugin, Create the Webpack stats JSON file, and Use the
analyzer.

In this section, you learned that:

-   Developers use different Webpack tools to reduce the bundle size for
    improving the performance of web applications.

-   BundlePhobia enables you to understand the performance cost of
    installing a package to an application.

-   Webpack visualizer is used for creating a visual representation of
    your final bundle.

-   Webpack Analyzer visualizes your bundle sizes by creating dependency
    graphs.

-   Source Map Explorer identifies the origin of minified code.

-   Webpack Bundle Analyzer helps to acknowledge the contents of the
    bundle and discover large modules.

# 23. Using Webpack with Frontend Frameworks {#using-webpack-with-frontend-frameworks .unnumbered}

Welcome to "Using Webpack with Frontend Frameworks.\"

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   explain the need for using Webpack with front-end frameworks,

-   and describe how to configure Webpack with Angular, Vue, and React.

Let's begin by understanding a front-end framework. A front-end
framework is a pre-prepared library meant to be used for the development
of a website. It is a collection of CSS, JavaScript, and other files
designed to make building web applications faster and more consistent.
Webpack is commonly used with frontend frameworks. It has several
features that are useful for building and deploying web applications.
Some of these features include: Code bundling, Module management, Code
optimization, and Easy integration. Let's discuss each of these features
in detail. The first feature is code bundling. Webpack can bundle all
JavaScript and CSS files for a web application into a single file,
making it efficient to load and run on a browser. The next feature is
module management. Webpack can manage the dependencies of a web
application, ensuring that all the necessary modules are included and
loaded in the correct order. Another important feature is code
optimization. Webpack can be configured to optimize and minify the code
for a production build, making it faster to load and run. The last
feature that we are going to discuss is easy integration. Webpack can be
easily integrated with a wide range of frontend frameworks, making it a
versatile tool for building web applications. These features make the
development process more efficient and the final product robust. Now,
let's discuss how to configure Webpack with Angular. However, before
that, we need to understand what Angular is. Angular is a JavaScript
framework developed and maintained by Google. It is used to create
Single-Page Applications (SPAs) that can dynamically update content
without requiring a page refresh. Configuring Webpack with Angular
involves a few steps. Let's explore these steps. First, you need to
create an application folder and name it. Click to open the folder, and
then create a file named package.json. This file contains project
configuration information, including package dependencies. To install
Angular libraries when configuring Webpack with Angular, you need to use
Node Package Manager (npm). Use the command as shown here: Npm install
\<library name\> Note that, like Angular libraries, dependencies can be
installed when configuring Webpack with Angular using npm. Webpack is a
JavaScript module bundler that can be extended with loaders to handle
other file types (for example, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS) and plugins to
perform other tasks, such as injecting generated JS bundles into an HTML
template (html-webpack-plugin). Here are the remaining steps of
configuring Webpack with Angular: Now, create a new component and a root
module to define the entry point of your application while configuring
Webpack with Angular. Note that an entry point is used by Angular to
bootstrap/launch the application\'s root module. Create the main
index.html file, which is the initial page loaded by a browser. To
ensure that the scripts are loaded and run by the browser, Webpack
groups all of the JavaScript files together and injects them into the
body of the index.html page. Next, click to open the project folder, and
then create a file named webpack.config.js. This file specifies the
configuration options used by Webpack to compile and bundle an Angular
app. Now, you can run the application. Use the command, as shown here:
ng serves - to run the application. Now we will discuss the process of
configuring Webpack with Vue. Before we proceed, let's try to understand
what Vue.js is. Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for
building user interfaces. It is designed to be approachable and easy to
learn.

Let's talk about the steps of configuring Webpack with Vue in detail.
First, create a new application folder. Note that all of your project
files will be stored in this folder. Now, create a package.json
configuration file. The primary point of contact between Webpack and
your code is this file. The entry point and output are specified. Next,
you need to install dependencies. For this, you can use the npm package
manager. Now, you need to configure Webpack to use the Babel loader and
the Vue loader. Here are the remaining steps of configuring Webpack with
Vue: Write the code to start your server. This can be done in
package.json using webpack-dev-serve. Use third-party extensions in your
Webpack configuration, such as loaders, plugins, and code splitting. For
this, you need to install them before adding them to your
webpack.config.js file. Check your Webpack configuration. You can run
the command, as shown here, in

your terminal. webpack \--config webpack.config.js \--display-modules

\--display-reasons All the modules that Webpack is using, along

with the reason why they are included, will appear. Also, you can use
webpack-validator, a tool that will validate your Webpack configuration
file and highlight any errors or potential issues. And lastly, we will
discuss the process of configuring Webpack with React. However, before
that, we need to be aware of React. React is a JavaScript library used
to build user interfaces. It was developed and is maintained by
Facebook. It focuses on the declarative approach to

programming, making it easier to understand and debug code. Now let\'s
explore the steps of configuring Webpack with React. The first step in
this process is setting up React. To set react, perform the following
steps: Set up the folder with npm and git.

Command to setup folder with npm: mkdir my-app

cd my-app npm init

Npm will now ask you a few brief questions about your project before
creating the package.json file in the root directory. To set up git for
your project, use this command: git init. Create a new source folder and
add HTML and JavaScript files. The second step of configuring Webpack
with React is to install and set up Webpack. To install Webpack to our
project, use the command as shown here. npm install webpack webpack-cli
webpack-dev-server \--save-devSetup configuration file --
webpack.config.js

This will install three packages: the
main Webpack package, webpack-cli to run Webpack commands,
and Webpack-dev-server to run React locally. Use the webpack.config.js
command to add the Webpack configuration file to the root folder. The
third step of configuring Webpack with React is to instruct Webpack
where to begin combining the JavaScript files, which means specifying
the entry point for Webpack. The fourth step of configuring Webpack with
React is to define the output path for the bundled file after the entry
point is defined. Here are the remaining steps of configuring Webpack
with React: Add the bundled JavaScript file to the HTML file. Install
Babel, which is the core transpiler, using the command shown here
Configure Webpack to use Babel.

Now that a configuration file is created, you can build and run the
application.

In this section, you learned about;

-   the need for using Webpack with front-end frameworks,

-   and the steps to configure Webpack with Angular, Vue, and React.

# 24. Webpack Best Practices {#webpack-best-practices .unnumbered}

Welcome to "Webpack Best Practices."

After watching this video, you will be able to:

-   identify some important best practices for optimizing Webpack,

-   and describe the benefits of implementing some key best practices in
    Webpack.

Webpack is a widely used module bundler that aids developers in building
effective and optimized web applications. It is an excellent tool for
creating applications; however, it can be challenging to get the most
out of it. In this video, we will learn about a few best practices for
optimizing Webpack to ensure that your applications are optimized and
efficient. The best practices we will explore in this session include:
Production builds,

Using source maps, Lazy loading modules, Exclusion and inclusion of
files, Reusing modules, Splitting vendor bundles, Caching approach, and

Tree shaking. The first best practice that we will explore is using the
production mode in Webpack. Using this mode has several benefits. It
helps in performance optimization. Webpack implements a number of
performance improvements when used in the production mode, including
code minification, tree shaking, and scope hoisting. These improvements
accelerate the loading of your application and help reduce the size of
the final output. Using the production mode also helps in debugging.
When running in the development mode, Webpack generates source maps that
can trace back errors to their original source. The optimizations
applied in the production mode can lead to a faster, more responsive
user experience, as the application loads faster and runs more
efficiently. To use the production mode in Webpack, you need to set the
mode configuration option to \"production.\" Another best practice
related to using Webpack is the use of source maps. Webpack combines all
the code in one or more bundles. These bundles can be difficult to debug
as the code is minified, making it hard to read and understand. Source
maps are a way to map the code back to its original source. This makes
debugging simpler and effective as it enables developers to test their
code in the same manner they would if it weren\'t bundled. Hence, source
maps provide an easier way to debug and understand the code, especially
in complex web development projects. The third best practice is lazy
loading. It is a technique of loading JavaScript modules only when they
are needed, rather than loading them all at once when the application
starts. After using the lazy-loaded modules, a large JavaScript file is
divided into multiple small JavaScript files and the web page is loaded
on demand. This accelerates the initial loading of the application and
reduces its overall weight as some blocks may never even be loaded. Now,
we will discuss the exclusion and inclusion of files. In Webpack, you
can use the \"exclude\" and \"include\" options to specify which files
should be included in the build output. The \"exclude\" option specifies
the files not required to be compiled. For example: node modules. The
\"include option\" specifies the files required to be compiled. For
example: the src folder. By using the \"exclude\" and \"include\"
options in Webpack, you can have greater control over which files are
processed, which helps enhance compilation efficiency. The fifth best
practice is reusing modules. Reusing modules in Webpack is a way to
optimize your build by sharing common code between multiple parts of
your application. This can help reduce the size of the final bundle,
which makes it easier to maintain and debug. Reusing modules also helps
save time and effort when building new projects. Additionally, by using
pre-existing modules, programmers may ensure that their code complies
with the latest standards and best practices related to improving the
performance of your application. Next, we will discuss bundle splitting
in

Webpack. It is a way of breaking your application into smaller,
independent chunks that can be loaded on demand, rather than loading the
entire code of your application at once. A chunk is a group of modules
that directly corresponds with the output bundle. Using
SplitChunksPlugin, we can split up a chunk into smaller chunks. Bundle
splitting is an effective way to optimize the performance of your
Webpack builds and is particularly useful for large applications with
many dependencies. This helps reduce the size of the initial load,
improving the performance of your application. Another popular practice
is caching. Caching in Webpack is a technique that allows the build
process to save the results of previous builds so that future builds can
be completed quickly. This helps improve performance by reducing the
amount of time spent on loading resources and reducing the amount of
bandwidth used. By employing caching techniques, developers can ensure
that each bundle contains only the necessary files, thereby reducing the
bundle size and accelerating builds. To implement caching strategies
with Webpack,

developers should use the webpack-bundle-analyzer plugin. Developers may
use this plugin to examine their bundles and determine which files are
duplicated or unnecessary. After these files are identified, developers
can create an appropriate caching strategy for them. The last best
practice to optimize Webpack that we are going to discuss is tree
shaking. It is an optimization technique used in Webpack to eliminate
unused code from the final bundle. It analyzes the imported and exported
modules in the code and removes the parts of the code not actually used
by the application. This results in a smaller and more efficient bundle,
which can improve performance and reduce the size of the application for
the end user. In Webpack5, tree shaking is enabled by default in the
production mode. In this video, you learned that:

Production mode helps in Webpack performance optimization. Source maps
help in tracing minified code back to its original location. Lazy
loading refers to the practice of loading JavaScript modules only when
they are required. The \"exclude\" and \"include\" options control which
files are included in the build output. Reusing modules reduces build
time by sharing common code across multiple parts of your application.
Splitting vendor bundles is a method of dividing your application into
smaller, self-contained chunks. Caching enables the build process to
save previous build results. Tree shaking removes unnecessary code from
the final bundle.

# 25. Reading: HTTPS & SSL Certificates {#reading-https-ssl-certificates .unnumbered}

## What is HTTPS? {#what-is-https .unnumbered}

Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of
HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web
browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase the
security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users
transmit sensitive data by logging into a bank account, email service,
or health insurance provider.

Any website, especially those that require login credentials, should use
HTTPS. In modern web browsers such as Chrome, websites that do not use
HTTPS are marked differently than those that are.

Look for a padlock in the URL bar to signify that the webpage is secure.
Web browsers take HTTPS seriously; Google Chrome and other browsers flag
all non-HTTPS websites as not secure.

## How does HTTPS work? {#how-does-https-work .unnumbered}

HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The
protocol is called Transport Layer Security (TLS), formerly known as
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This protocol secures communications by
using what's known as an asymmetric public key infrastructure. This type
of security system uses two different keys to encrypt communications
between two parties:

The private key - this key is controlled by the owner of a website, and
it's kept, as the reader may have speculated, private. This key lives on
a web server and is used to decrypt information encrypted by the public
key.

The public key - this key is available to everyone who wants to interact
with the server in a way that's secure. Information that's encrypted by
the public key can only be decrypted by the private key.

## How does a website start using HTTPS? {#how-does-a-website-start-using-https .unnumbered}

Many website hosting providers and other services will offer TLS/SSL
certificates for a fee. These certificates will often be shared amongst
many customers. More expensive certificates are available, which can be
individually registered to particular web properties.

## What is an SSL Certificate? {#what-is-an-ssl-certificate .unnumbered}

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, and, in short, it\'s the standard
technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding
any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing
criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred,
including potential personal details. The two systems can be a server
and a client (for example, a shopping website and browser) or server to
server (for example, an application with personal identifiable
information or with payroll information).

It does this by making sure that any data transferred between users and
sites or between two systems remain impossible to read. It uses
encryption algorithms to scramble data in transit, preventing hackers
from reading it as it is sent over the connection. This information
could be anything sensitive or personal which can include credit card
numbers and other financial information, names, and addresses.

TLS (Transport Layer Security) is just an updated, more secure version
of SSL.

## How Does an SSL Certificate Work? {#how-does-an-ssl-certificate-work .unnumbered}

SSL certificates protect data transfer using two different encryption
techniques: asymmetric and symmetric.

Asymmetric encryption uses two separate keys: a public and a private
key. The public key is used to encrypt the message, which can only be
decrypted by the private key, and vice versa. On the other hand,
symmetric encryption uses one shared key, or a pair of keys, to encrypt
and decrypt the message.

To give a better understanding of how those encryption techniques work,
here's an overview of the process:

-   First, a website owner purchases an SSL certificate from a
    Certificate Authority (CA) and installs it on their site.

-   When a visitor navigates through the website, the browser and the
    web server establish an SSL connection using a method called **SSL
    handshake**.

-   During the SSL handshake, the browser asks the server for its SSL
    certificate and public key to prove its validity.

-   Once the certificate is verified, the browser and web server
    exchange private and public keys to create a symmetric session key.

-   Both parties then use this symmetric key to encrypt all
    communications. This key will remain valid for a limited time and
    only for that particular session.

# 26. JavaScript Optimization {#javascript-optimization .unnumbered}

Welcome to JavaScript Optimization. After watching this video, you will
be able to: define web optimization and JavaScript, explain how web
optimization impacts website success factors, identify some popular web
performance optimization methods, and define how JavaScript can improve
a web application's performance. Web optimization determines how quickly
a website loads and becomes responsive and interactive and how smoothly
the content is presented when users interact with it. JavaScript is
capable of producing highly interactive websites that actively engage
the user. However, increased engagement levels can negatively impact a
website's usability. It is important to minimize loading and response
times and add additional features to conceal inactivity by making the
experience as available and interactive as possible. Web optimization
impacts the crucial factors that determine website success. The first
factor is conversion rate. This metric is crucial for a business\'s
success as it indicates that the target audience completes the actions
you want them to perform, such as purchasing a product, subscribing to a
newsletter, registering for a webinar, or downloading a step-by-step
guide. The higher the conversion rate, the faster the loading time.
Another important factor is visibility. Page speed is a critical ranking
factor. A low-performing website with poor user experience and long
loading times will be penalized by search engines and have a lower SERP
ranking. The last factor is website usability, which helps to increase
or establish customer loyalty. The better the website behaves, the
happier the end users are.

Let's now talk about a few web performance optimization methods. Content
delivery networks (CDNs) were created to address the issues associated
with network communication delays. A version of the content is stored in
various geographical locations by CDN. By handling the performance
middle mile, a CDN brings the user closer to resources. The number of
trips the server makes is significantly reduced, resulting in a faster
loading process. File Compression The HTML, JS, and CSS code files are
the foundation of every website. The longer it takes to load a page, the
more complex it is. These large code files should be compressed to their
original size to improve site responsiveness. You can use GZip and other
well-known programs for data compression and decompression. Resource
minification Resource minification removes unnecessary code redundancy
from CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, resulting in smaller page sizes.
Reducing the amount of code that needs to be fetched from the server
speeds up front-end loading. The tool used to generate minified codes
for JavaScript is JSMin, CSS is cssmin and YUI Compressor, and for HTML
is PageSpeed Insights. Optimize Images and videos. High-resolution
images and videos significantly slow down the rendering process.
Compressing images without sacrificing quality is possible with tools
like Compressor.io, JPEGmini, and TinyPNG. HTML responsive images and
attributes can also be used as it adjusts image size based on the
display properties of the user's device. Animated WebP can be used for
videos or replaced with an HTML5 video tag. Use caching When a user
visits a website, the elements are saved in a temporary hard drive
storage area known as a cache. Caching saves a copy of the latest
version of the website on the hosting server and allows the user to
access the cached copy rather than the original copy later. This
practice enables the pages to load faster. There are various types of
caching, such as browser cache, cache server, memory cache, and disc
cache, that help to increase delivery speed. Minimize HTTP Requests If
your website makes a lot of HTTP requests, the web pages will take
longer to load. Determine the number of HTTP requests and then use some
techniques to reduce the number of requests. Avoid using extra plugins,
images, JavaScript, and CSS. Combine your JavaScript and CSS files into
a single package. Only use third-party frameworks when necessary.

JavaScript is becoming a popular language for creating web applications.
Here are some important points on how JavaScript can improve the
performance of your web application. Asynchronous programming The
async.js feature of JavaScript aids in the efficient management of
asynchronous codes. As a result, async code is pushed to an event queue,
where it executes after all other code has been completed. Light and
small code files Keeping the code light and small reduces latency and
increases speed. Multiple JS files can be combined into one to improve
application performance. Gzip compression Most clients and servers use
Gzip as a compression and decompression software application. It
compresses large JavaScript files and saves bandwidth, reducing latency
and time lag and improving overall application performance. Utilize
HTTP/2 HTTP/2 uses multiplexing, allowing multiple responses and
requests to be sent simultaneously. It improves not only JavaScript
performance but also website speed. Avoid Unnecessary Loops Unnecessary
looping is unfavorable. Try to do as much work as possible outside of
loops because the faster the loops get, the less you loop. Loops place
additional strain on the browser and slow down the entire process.
Placement of Scripts JavaScript should be placed at the bottom of the
page to improve both rendering progress and download parallelization. It
will save the total amount of code required and make the page load
faster. In this video, you learned that: Web performance assesses site
load time and responsiveness of the displayed content. JavaScript
produces highly interactive websites that actively engage the user. Key
factors of web optimization are conversion rate, visibility, and
usability. Web performance optimization provides user information
quickly while ensuring a smooth interactive experience, and JavaScript
tips affect the performance of a web application and how to improve it.

# 27. Popular Optimization Tools {#popular-optimization-tools .unnumbered}

Welcome to Popular Optimization Tools!

After watching this video, you'll be able to: Identify the various
approaches to web optimization and List the key optimization tools used
in each approach. The goal of website optimization is to make a website
as appealing to search engines and users as possible. To achieve this,
the first step is to identify problems. Before any great optimization
process begins, it is necessary to determine what is wrong with the
current website. Simply brainstorming potential issues is not enough.
Instead, we need to use available software tools to look for potential
issues. Some of the factors that require the use of optimization tools
include: Page speed, User experience (UX),

Mobile, Web accessibility, and JavaScript. Let's discuss some of the
best, most-used, and most productive website optimization tools you
should consider adding to your website.

Let\'s start with page speed optimization tools. A slow website can
drive users away and affect search rankings. Web page speed tools do not
automatically fix your slow site. Instead, they measure the page speed
and show you what\'s slowing it down. You\'ll be able to determine how
to improve page load times by implementing certain measures. These
include: Reducing and compressing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images,
Caching content, and Using faster hosting servers. Some of the popular
page speed optimization tools include: PageSpeed Insights Gtmetrix
Pingdom, and WebPageTest Next, we'll discuss user experience (UX)
optimization tools. Great UX will keep visitors happy and reduce
friction on your website, resulting in higher conversion rates and
revenue. Usability testing will help you understand user behavior and
diagnose problems so you can optimize pages and give people what they
need to continue browsing and purchasing from your website smoothly. UX
tools aid in every stage of the page optimization process, from
identifying where users are getting stuck to conducting user research.

Some of the popular UX optimization tools include: Hotjar UserTesting
TryMyUI, and UsabilityHub Let\'s look at mobile optimization tools now.
Mobile-first optimization can help you ensure that users see your site
properly on smartphones and tablets, as more people use mobile devices
than desktop computers to browse the web. Pop-ups, image-heavy pages,
and small texts can make your website difficult to navigate on
smartphones. Analyze your analytics data to determine what percentage of
your users and customers browse on mobile devices, so you can determine
how important mobile optimization is to your business.

Some of the popular mobile optimization tools include:

PageSpeed Insights Google Search Console Google Analytics, and
WebPageTest Next, we will discuss web accessibility optimization tools.
An accessible website is simple to use for everyone, which is a win-win
situation for both you and your visitors: great UX for them and more
satisfied customers for you. Accessibility tools can show you how your
landing pages appear on a screen reader or to people with different
impairments (for example, different types of colorblindness). The tools
can also provide optimization recommendations to make your website more
inclusive. Some of the popular web accessibility optimization tools
include: WAVE EqualWeb, and Functional Accessibility Evaluator Finally,
let's talk about JavaScript optimization tools. If it is discovered that
the functionality is not being used by users, the best practice is to
remove it along with all associated JavaScript code sets. This will
reduce not only the transmission time but also the time the browser
takes to analyze and compile the code. Some of the popular JavaScript
optimization tools include: JS Minifier is a web-based tool to compress
JavaScript code to make it as light as possible. JSMIN is a popular
JavaScript minifier that removes unnecessary characters (such as spaces
and tabs) and comments, reducing the file size of your script. Flow,
which is a static type of JavaScript code checker that works hard to
increase your productivity, making your code faster, smarter, more
confident, and more broadly applicable. ESLint, which is a linting tool
that helps automatically check your code for potential problems, and
Optimize-js, which optimizes a JavaScript file for faster initial
execution and parsing by enclosing all functions that are immediately
invoked or are likely to be invoked in parentheses. In this video, you
learned that: Web optimization makes a website appealing to search
engines and users. It helps select an appropriate software tool for
potential problems. Page speed optimization tools assess the page speed
and determine what is slowing it down. UX optimization tools keep
visitors engaged and reduce friction on websites. Mobile optimization
tools ensure that users see websites properly on smartphones and
tablets. Web accessibility optimization tools preview landing screens
and provide optimized recommendations, and JavaScript optimization tools
remove unnecessary codes, which reduces the time required for browsers
to analyze and compile code.

# 28. Testing Frameworks {#testing-frameworks .unnumbered}

Welcome to Testing Frameworks. After watching this video, you will be
able to: define testing frameworks and their components, list the key
benefits of testing a framework, and identify the popular JavaScript
testing frameworks. A testing framework is a set of rules or guidelines
that can be used to develop and design test cases. While a test
automation framework is a collection of components that make it easier
to run tests and report on test results. Coding standards, test-data
handling methods, object repositories, processes for storing test
results, and information on how to access external resources are all
covered in the testing framework guidelines. The JavaScript testing
framework is a JS-based dynamic framework that is well-known for its
ease of use in front-end and back-end development. Front-end testing is
a method of testing the Graphical User Interface (GUI), functionality,
and usability of web applications or software. The goal of front-end
testing is to ensure that the presentation layer of web applications or
software is defect free with subsequent updates. Front-end testing is
also performed for: CSS Regression Testing for minor CSS changes that
break the front-end layout. JS file changes that render the front-end
unusable. and performance evaluations. Let\'s now explore the various
components of a testing framework. Let's first learn about testing data
management. The most challenging aspect of software testing automation
is gathering data and extracting useful information. The availability of
data to conduct tests is typically a major issue. A strategic approach
to testing data management is required to ensure the success of
automation efforts. Next, we will learn about testing libraries. A
testing library is where test cases are created and stored. Unit
testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, and behavior-driven
development are all examples of testing libraries. Following that, we
will learn about Integration testing. Testing units in isolation is
valuable and necessary, but you must also test the integrations between
both units, as well as between units and external dependencies, if you
want to ensure that your application works as intended. Finally, let's
learn about behavior-driven development (BBD). BDD is not related to
development. It's a collection of best practices. BDD enables you to
write great test cases when those practices are applied to automation
testing. It\'s written in an English-like language that everyone can
understand. It helps turn scenarios and expected behavior features into
code. BDD allows code to be aligned with the intent and scope of
automated tests. Let\'s look at some of the benefits of the testing
framework. The first benefit is that testing frameworks help to make the
project more agile. When you add a new feature, you may need to change
the old code. Changing previously tested code is both expensive and
risky. Testing frameworks assist you in running unit tests on new code
to ensure that it does not break any existing features. The next benefit
is that it helps find bugs early. As a developer, you can use the
testing framework to find and fix bugs on your own, which will improve
code quality and make testing easier. Next, we will discuss how it helps
with code integrity. The term code integrity refers to achieving the
results that the developer intended. The results should also be
repeatable in any scenario in which the code or program is likely to be
used. By automating the task of running tests after code changes,
testing frameworks reduce manual overhead. Lastly, we will discuss how
it helps with code optimization. The best way to achieve the desired
result is to use optimized code. Testing assists developers in
optimizing their code so that their program uses fewer resources while
still providing the necessary functionality. We will now learn about
some of the popular JavaScript testing frameworks. First, let's learn
about Jest. The React development team officially supports Jest. Jest is
a JavaScript testing framework that places an emphasis on simplicity. It
is compatible with projects written in Babel, TypeScript, Node, React,
Angular, Vue, and other languages. Next, we will learn about Playwright.
Playwright is a web testing and automation framework. It enables the
testing of Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit using a single API. Playwright
is designed to enable cross-browser web automation and automation that
is always up-to-date, reliable, and fast. The next framework is Mocha.
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework that runs on Node.js
and in the browser to make asynchronous testing easy and fun. Mocha
tests are executed sequentially, allowing for flexible and accurate
reporting while mapping undetected exceptions to the appropriate test
cases. Let's now look at Cypress. Cypress is a JavaScript-based
end-to-end testing framework built on Mocha that makes asynchronous
testing simple and easy. To pair with any JavaScript testing framework,
the Cypress testing library also employs a BDD/TDD assertion library and
a browser. The next JavaScript framework that we will discuss is
Jasmine. Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for
JavaScript code testing. It is independent of any other JavaScript
framework. It does not require the use of a DOM. It also has a clear
syntax that makes it simple to write tests. The last framework that we
will discuss is Puppeteer. Puppeteer is a Node.js library that allows
you to control Chrome/Chromium via the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer is
designed to run in headless mode by default, but it can also be
configured to run in full (non-headless) Chrome/Chromium mode. In this
video, you learned that: A testing framework is a set of rules or
guidelines that can be used to develop and design test cases. JavaScript
testing framework is dynamic and well-known for its ease of use in
front-end and back-end development. Components of a framework are a
group of tools and processes that work together to support automated
application testing. Testing framework helps make the project agile,
fixes bugs, and helps achieve code integrity and optimization, and some
popular JavaScript testing frameworks are Jest, Playwright, Mocha,
Cypress, Jasmine, and Puppeteer.

# 29. Testing Tools -- Mocha and Jasmine {#testing-tools-mocha-and-jasmine .unnumbered}

Welcome to \"Testing Tools -- Mocha and Jasmine.\"

After watching this video, you'll be able to: define Mocha and Jasmine
testing frameworks, list their advantages and disadvantages, and
recognize the differences between the two frameworks. Mocha is a
NodeJS-based open-source JavaScript testing framework.

It prioritizes core features and extensibility. Mocha tests are executed
sequentially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting while mapping
uncaught exceptions to the appropriate test cases. Mocha allows you to
write structured code to thoroughly test your applications,
categorizing them into test suites and test cases. Mapping errors to
corresponding test cases enables us to generate a test report following
the run. Mocha supports a wide range of test interfaces, such as TSS,
Exports, QUnit, and Require. The default interface is a BDD interface,
which aims to assist developers in creating predictable and resilient
to-change software rather than error-prone software. Mocha is a simple
and adaptable framework that works with any assertion library. The most
popular assertion libraries with Mocha are Chai, Sinon, Express.js, and
Should.js. Mocha provides the framework for running your tests, whether
they are low-level Unit tests against back-end services or JavaScript
functions or full-stack tests focused on component integration. Mocha
can be used to run any type of test within describe functions by
including code and assertions to determine a pass or fail status. Mocha
will report the test as failed if an assertion fails. If a code throws
an exception, it is marked as failed as well. It will report a pass if
everything runs smoothly and all assertions are valid. Because of
Node\'s asynchronous behavior, Mocha can also notify you if your tests
run too long Let\'s take a look at some of the advantages of using the
Mocha testing framework. It encourages Test Driven Development (TDD) and
Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It runs tests serially, and the
results are always accurate. It can be configured to run test cases in
the web browser. It offers several ways to generate test reports and can
even create custom reports. It can be set up for either synchronous or
asynchronous testing. It includes a wide variety of plugins that can be
used to extend your framework. Following the test run, it highlights the
slow-running tests. It supports the retry failed tests feature, which
allows you to configure re-running failed tests. The following are some
of Mocha\'s drawbacks.

The developer must spend time configuring the Mocha framework. Snapshot
testing is not supported by default; you must rely on external
libraries. Despite having good documentation, the search feature is not
user-friendly. Since you need to integrate different frameworks for
assertions, the test scripts can be confusing at times. Mocha is slow to
release new features and support developer tools. Mocha requires more
configuration than other frameworks, making it less flexible. In the
case of Mocha, if you cannot afford flexibility, you must explicitly
select an assertion library. Mocha snapshot testing can be challenging.
To do it correctly, you\'ll need to use the chai-jest-snapshot library.
Jasmine is an open-source JavaScript framework that can test any
JavaScript application. Jasmine uses the BDD procedure to ensure that
each line of JavaScript code is unit tested. Instead of testing the
entire application, it offers a small syntax to test the smallest unit
of the application. It also includes utilities for running automated
tests on both synchronous and asynchronous code. Jasmine is tested in a
variety of browsers, including Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft
Edge, as well as Node. Jasmine has many features, including: It\'s fast,
has low overhead, and has no external dependencies. It\'s a
batteries-included library with everything you need to test your code.
It is available for both Node and browser. It is compatible with other
languages, such as Python and Ruby. It does not require the DOM. It has
a clean and simple syntax as well as a rich and straightforward API. We
can describe the tests and the expected results using natural language.
The following are some of the advantages of using Jasmine: It has lower
overhead due to no external dependencies. It proceeds with nearly every
required tool by default. It maintains front-end and back-end tests
similarly.

The coding is pretty similar to writing in natural language. It provides
wide documentation for use with a variety of frameworks. It supports
asynchronous testing. It marks the use of spies for applying test
doubles. Now, let\'s look at the main disadvantages of using Jasmine
they are: Asynchronous testing is difficult. All test files must have a
specific suffix. Now that we\'ve learned about the Mocha and Jasmine
frameworks, let\'s compare them. Jasmine includes an assertion library,
whereas Mocha must be combined with other assertion libraries. Jasmine
and Mocha both have command-line test runners. For reporting, Jasmine
creates karma-jasmine-html-reporter or jasmine-pretty-html-reporter,
whereas Mocha creates mocha-simple-html-reporter and mochawesome.
Jasmine and Mocha both have documentation and forum support. Jasmine
does not include built-in support for rerunning a failed test, whereas
Mocha does. Slow tests can be highlighted in Jasmine using
jasmine-slow-reporter, whereas Mocha has built-in support. Asynchronous
testing is challenging in Jasmine but simple in Mocha. Jasmine and Mocha
both support parallel execution. Jasmine\'s plug-in support and
extensibility are limited, whereas Mocha\'s are good.

In this video, you learned that: Mocha is a NodeJS-based open-source
JavaScript testing framework. It is compatible with assertion libraries
like Chai, Sinon, Express.js, and Should.js. It uses code and assertions
to determine a pass or fail status. Jasmine is an open-source JavaScript
framework that can test any JavaScript application. It is fast, has low
overhead, has no external dependencies, and slow tests can be
highlighted in Jasmine using jasmine-slow-reporter, whereas Mocha has it
built-in.

# 30. Using Jasmine {#using-jasmine .unnumbered}

Welcome to Using Jasmine!

After watching this video, you will be able to: Define Jasmine and its
fundamental concepts, and identify the steps to test code and React with
Jasmine. Jasmine is an open-source framework for unit testing JavaScript
that is readily accessible in a variety of formats, including
stand-alone, ruby gem, Node.js, and so on. It is simple to set up and
easy to write tests. JS Spec, Rspec, and Jspec have a significant impact
on Jasmine. It makes an attempt to describe tests in a human-readable
format so that non-technical people understand what is being tested.
Let's look at the fundamental concepts of Jasmine.

A Jasmine suite is a collection of test cases that can be used to verify
the behavior of a JavaScript object or function. This starts with a call
to the Jasmine global function, which has two parameters: the first is
the title of the test suite, and the second is a function that
implements the test suite. A Jasmine spec is a test case within a test
suite. This begins with a call to the Jasmine global function with two
parameters: the first is the title of the spec, and the second is a
function that implements the test case. The spec includes one or more
expectations. Each expectation represents a statement that can be true
or false. To pass the spec, all of the expectations within the spec must
be met. If one or more expectations within a spec are incorrect, the
spec fails. In Jasmine, an expectation is an assertion that is either
true or false. Expectations are described as \"expect\" within the
function that takes a value, which is referred to as the \"toBe\" value.
Matchers is a comparison between the actual value and the expected
value, either if the expectation is \"true\" or \"false." The describe
function in Jasmine is used to group related specs. The string parameter
is used to name the collection of specs and will be integrated with
specs to form the full name of a spec. This helps in locating specs in a
large suite. Jasmine has spies, which are test double functions. A spy
can stub any function and track all calls and arguments to it. A spy
exists only in the describe or it block in which it is defined and is
removed after each spec. Spies are mocks. Mocks are objects that are
created to represent or mimic the real thing. Mocks are required to
avoid the overhead cost of creating the actual object they represent.
The steps to begin testing with Jasmine are as follows. Download Jasmine
(standalone version). Give Jasmine access to your code by manually
downloading it or using a package manager. Initialize Jasmine. Create a
spec (test) file, and Make the source code available to your spec file.
Let us now try to understand the steps for testing React with Jasmine.
First, install and set up Jasmine. Next, set up React with add-ons.
Depending on your React version and environment, you will either need to
use a version of React that includes add-ons or the
react-addons-test-utils npm package. In either case, the version of
React that Jasmine runs must be included in the JS bundle. The next step
is to leverage Test Utils. ReactTestUtils makes it simple to test React
components in your preferred testing framework. Then, in Jasmine, learn
the structure of a React test. There is a specific sequence of calls
that must be made in order to render and test a full instance of your
component. Discover how to use new matchers and utilities.

Finally, as needed, add new React test utils methods and Jasmine
matchers. You don\'t have to be familiar with every matcher and method
in the React test utilities.

After you\'ve mastered the basics of writing unit tests, you can move on
to using React event simulation and Jasmine spies to see what happens
when users interact with your components. In this video, you learned
that:

Jasmine is an open-source framework for unit testing JavaScript.

It is accessible in a variety of formats, including stand-alone, ruby
gem, and Node.js. The fundamental concepts of Jasmine are suite, spec,
matchers, expectations, describe functions, and spies, and There are
five steps to testing codes and React with Jasmine.

# 31. Front-end Testing Best Practices {#front-end-testing-best-practices .unnumbered}

Welcome to \"Front-end Testing Best Practices.\"

After watching this video, you will be able to: define front-end testing
and its advantages, identify what aspect of an application\'s front end
should be tested, and list some of the best front-end testing practices.
The front end of a program is the client-side section. Front-end testing
is the process of testing the usability and functionality of an
application\'s graphical user interface (GUI). This usually includes
validating menus, forms, buttons, and other application elements visible
to end users. Every web application is built with a three-tier
architecture. Clients, servers, and information systems or resources are
all included. The client is part of the presentation layer. This layer
is tested by front-end testers. We will now discuss some of the
advantages of using front-end testing. First, an app should provide
accurate interaction. It should be fast and error-free, regardless of
the device or browser used. Front-end testers perform the test using a
variety of devices and browsers. They declare an app error-free only if
it meets all the testing criteria. Next, your HTML code must adhere to
certain standards, and your website should be accessible to all users,
particularly those with disabilities. Accessibility testing is a
required component of front-end testing and must be completed prior to
the deployment of a website. With the widespread use of interconnected
versions of an app on different devices such as a smartwatch,
smartphone, and smart TV, front-end testing helps ensure consistent
behavior of the app across the multitier architecture. Front-end tests
also protect your app from regression. There may be times when you write
code to deploy large or complex features, but it crashes another part of
the application that you were unaware of. Front-end testing ensures that
the code is consistent and that the front-end functionality is intact.
Next, if a bug is discovered, whether by your team or by users, you need
to fix it and prevent its recurrence unexpectedly by adding an
additional test suite through front-end testing. Finally, a thorough
explanation of the test\'s functionality is necessary when writing
tests.

Front-end testing helps in keeping well-maintained tests which is
beneficial as they serve as live documentation. Let us now try to
understand which aspects of an application\'s front end you need to
focus on while performing front-end testing. When testing cross-browser
and cross-platform functionality, you should look at your app\'s
features and its responsiveness across different browsers, platforms,
and devices. Accessibility checks help you determine whether everyone,
including those with visual or auditory impairments, can use the
application. End-to-end checks are required for checking and confirming
the application\'s back-end to front-end workflow by simulating
real-world actions that users are likely to take. Image analysis testing
is performed to determine where you can optimize the images to help the
app run faster. Most websites and apps these days have a large number of
images, which significantly increases the size of the application. CSS
testing ensures the performance of two important CSS elements: syntax
and display. While syntax is more of a developer\'s day-to-day
responsibility, displayed views must be tested for regression after
changes to specific parts of the app. Now we\'ll explore some of the
best front-end testing practices. These include: Focusing on front-end
elements, Using actual browsers and devices, Performing deterministic
tests, Striving for coverage and not 100% code coverage, Encouraging
shorter and more readable unit tests, Keeping tests independent, and
Testing a variety of input parameters. Let us now discuss each in
detail. Focusing on front-end elements Front-end testing involves
examining and validating hundreds or thousands of UI and functional
elements. Before moving on to graphics and pop-ups, it\'s a good idea to
test the page load speed, basic text, images, and essential functions.
Using actual browsers and devices Use real browsers and devices instead
of emulators and simulators to save time and money and enhance the
reliability of your software testing results. Performing deterministic
tests Deterministic tests are the ones that can be repeated. They
produce the same results every time a specific code is executed. A
non-deterministic test passes and fails randomly. Non-deterministic
tests can be handled in a variety of ways, including polling, fake
timers, and mocks. Striving for coverage and not 100% code coverage In
theory, complete test coverage sounds like a great idea. However, it
doesn\'t work in practice. A high level of test coverage provides a
false sense of security. Good tests are simple to maintain and provide
you with the confidence to make changes to your code. Encouraging
shorter and more readable unit tests A unit test should only test a
single unit of code. If there is only one reason for the test to fail,
less time is spent determining the root cause of the test's failure.
Keeping tests independent The outcome of one test should have no impact
on the results of any other tests. Sharing state or mock instances
between tests may result in brittle or \"flaky\" tests that pass
incorrectly. Testing a variety of input parameters Tests should validate
all possible code paths through the code under test. You must be
confident that the deployed code can handle the full range of inputs
that a user may enter. There are numerous vendors offering front-end
testing tools, making it difficult to decide which one to use. For your
convenience, here is a list of some of the best and most widely used
front-end testing tools. Jest, Selenium WebDriver, Cypress, WebDriverIO,
WebDriverJS, and Jasmine.

In this video, you learned that: front-end testing is the process of
testing the usability and functionality of an application\'s GUI, It
validates menus, forms, buttons, and other app elements visible to
users. It provides accurate interactions, offers accessibility, ensures
consistent behavior and others.

There are certain aspects of an application\'s front end that need to be
focused on while performing front-end testing, and front-end testing
tools ensure proper functionality of critical elements of a web page.

# 32. JavaScript Debugging {#javascript-debugging .unnumbered}

Welcome to "JavaScript Debugging." After watching this video, you will
be able to: Describe debugging, Describe the process of debugging
JavaScript, Explain the benefits of debugging, and Identify some common
JavaScript bugs. Errors are common while writing programs. These errors
or flaws are bugs. If your JavaScript does not function the way you want
it to, there is a high possibility that you have a bug in your code.
Therefore, we use debugging, which identifies and fixes bugs in your
code. In computer programming and engineering, debugging is essential to
software development. It is necessary to remove bugs that occur
accidentally or unexpectedly in software applications. Tightly coupled
modules can make debugging difficult at times. In this case, changing
one module can cause more bugs to appear in another. There can be more
challenges involved in debugging such a program, than coding a single
program. Let\'s try to understand why bugs occur in JavaScript. If your
script isn\'t working, first check the punctuation. Ensure there is a
closing bracket for every opening bracket. Second, check the character
string. Always enclose the text in quotation marks when working on
JavaScript. You can either use single or double quotation marks to
enclose the text. Now that you know why bugs occur in JavaScript and how
to prevent them, let's explore the debugging process. Debugging
JavaScript in a production environment can be challenging as the error
reports are sometimes vague, and identifying the underlying causes can
be difficult. Nevertheless, identifying and fixing bugs can be done by
following a few steps. These are:

Attempting to replicate the bug, Hypothesis testing,

Increasing the number of logging-of statements, and Adjusting test
scenarios and trying again. Let's discuss each step in detail. The first
step in debugging is to replicate the circumstances. In most programming
languages, it is facilitated by reviewing logs preceding an error. If
you have access to production logs, you must establish some testing
guidelines before replicating any circumstances of an issue. The
operating system, production database, and user accounts are all
replicated in this process. After identifying the conditions, you
believe will result in the exception or error you\'re looking for, you
must put them to the test. Development and staging environments are
breakable without affecting end users, therefore, you should always try
to break your code in a safe environment. Next, you need to log more
data to diagnose the problem. You can observe everything before and
after the issue arises. The issues you are facing likely have possible
warnings attached to them, which don\'t always appear in the logs by
default. Every error is difficult to reproduce, and replicating them in
a non-production environment can be difficult due to time constraints or
other factors. Return to the first step and try it all over again. Now
that you know how to debug JavaScript errors, let's discuss the
importance of debugging. Errors can occur while writing codes, and it is
important to fix the errors. Debugging helps by breaking down complex
problems into smaller ones and expediting the process of writing codes
for the software. While implementing the code, avoid making any
syntactic or other types of errors. The process continues in stages,
combining the code with other programming units to form a software
product. Debugging allows you to stop your code when it reaches a point
where you suspect a logic or implementation problem and investigate
whether it is doing what you expected. You can achieve the same result
by including printouts in your code. Debugging offers various benefits.
It immediately reports an error condition. As a result, the error is
found early, ensuring the software development process is less
stressful. It provides critical information about data structures and
facilitates interpretation. It helps the developer reduce unnecessary
and distracting information. It allows the developer to avoid writing
complex one-time testing codes, saving time and energy required for
software development. Let's explore some reasons for JavaScript bugs in
your code. These include: Incorrect data types, Incorrect use of
assignment operators, Incorrect use of quotation marks, Incorrect use of
brackets, Incorrect Indexing, Misspelling of function and variable
names, and Incorrect use of variable assignment. Let's discuss each
reason in detail. The interaction of variables of different types can
result in many bugs in your code. For example, if you use a string with
a number. It is important to check the places where the equal sign is
used instead of an equality operator because it is an assignment
operator in JavaScript. In contrast, the double and the triple equal
signs check if values are equal. In JavaScript, you can use different
quotation marks to enclose quotation marks within quotation marks. You
may face issues if you use double quotations. Another error that we see
quite often is the incorrect use of brackets. There must be an opening
bracket and a closing bracket for the script. JavaScript employs base
zero indexing. You can obtain the first value of an array by using index
zero. As the result is off by one, this frequently results in an \"index
out of range\" reference error in JavaScript. Missing letters and wrong
capitalization also lead to bugs in the code. Coders can use code
editors to reduce misspelled function names and variables. Global
variables are created outside and can be used everywhere, in contrast to
local variables, created inside a function to be utilized by the
function. The distinction between global and local variables is that
creating global variables is outside. Its usage can be everywhere,
whereas local variables are created inside a function. Its usage is by
function.

In this video, you learned about:

Debugging is an essential part of the software development process. A
few steps are used to recognize and fix bugs. Debugging has many
benefits. You can encounter JavaScript bugs in your code due to some
factors.

# 33. Basic Debugging Concepts {#basic-debugging-concepts .unnumbered}

Welcome to "Basic Debugging Concepts."

After watching this video, you will be able to:

-   describe debugging strategies,

-   identify the types of bugs,

-   and explain the terminologies used in debugging.

If your program does not generate the desired output, there is a high
possibility that your code contains errors. This is why debugging is a
crucial step in the software development process, as it identifies and
fixes bugs. A major part of the debugging process involves identifying
the cause based on the symptoms. Different strategies can be employed to
localize the error, as there is no best method for doing it. Each
strategy is suited to a different situation; therefore, it is beneficial
to be aware of these strategies. Some of these include: Incremental
development, Debuggers, Binary search, Instrumentation, Assertions,
Backtracking, Simplify, Error-finding tools, and Hypotheses. Let's
review each of them in detail. In this strategy, the program is
developed progressively, with frequent testing performed as each new
piece of code is added. As the final chunk of code is small in
incrementally developed programs, the search for bugs is constrained to
small code fragments. As a result, there are fewer errors, and the
programmer is not burdened with long lists of errors. This strategy
involves providing all the necessary run-time information without
generating voluminous difficult-to-read log files by observing program
expressions, setting program breakpoints, and analyzing the memory
content at selected points during execution. This strategy places a
check halfway through

a large piece of code. If the error does not appear at that point, the
bug is in the second half. As a result, the amount of code that must be
inspected reduces by half. The process quickly leads to the actual
problem if repeated. This strategy involves inserting print statements.
Although printed information is useful in some cases, it can be
challenging to examine when the amount of information grows
significantly. In this case, automated scripts can be used to sort
through the data and provide pertinent portions in a more concise style.
This strategy is used to verify that the program maintains the
properties or invariants on which your code is based. The point at which
the program terminates is likely to be much closer to the cause and a
good indicator of what the issue is, as the program terminates as soon
as an assertion fails. The next strategy is backtracking. This involves
starting at the problem\'s origin and working your way back through the
code to determine how it occurred. This strategy involves removing the
sections of the code irrelevant to the bug and simplifying the code in
the body of the buggy function. As the process continues, the code
becomes increasingly simpler. The bug will eventually be discovered.
Data can also be simplified using a similar method. If the input data is
too big, continuously remove parts of it to check if the bug still
exists. Here, programmers can quickly identify violations of particular
classes of errors using error-finding tools. For example, tools that
check safety properties. Error-finding tools use either static analysis
or dynamic analysis. This strategy involves a few steps. First, review
the test case results. Next, develop a hypothesis that fits the data,
and then create and execute a simple test to refute the hypothesis. If
the hypothesis is rejected, generate another one and repeat the process.
Finding the simplest hypotheses and associated test cases is an
effective strategy. Let's now explore different types of bugs. A program
may contain bugs even after meticulous planning and defensive
programming. There are different types of errors that one may
experience. These are: Type errors, Minor errors, Implementation errors,
and Conceptual errors. Let's discuss each type of error in detail. The
compiler always detects and reports such errors via error messages. An
error message typically includes information about the root cause of the
error, such as the incorrect piece of code, the line number, and an
explanation. These notifications typically provide sufficient details of
the nature of the issue and what needs to be done. Errors such as typos
or other simple errors may escape detection by the type checker or other
compiler checks. These are simple to fix after they are identified.
While a program\'s high-level algorithm may follow the correct logic,
some low-level, tangible data structures may be mishandled, violating
certain internal representation invariants. This can lead to
implementation errors. The programmer must reconsider the algorithm if
it has logical errors. Fixing such issues is more challenging,
particularly if the program only fails in a small number of corner
cases. One must carefully consider the algorithm and attempt to develop
a justification for its effectiveness. If the algorithm is too complex,
it may be better to redo it from scratch and create a cleaner design.
Let's now discuss some important terminologies used in debugging. These
are: Application log, Debugger, Stepping, Stack, Breakpoints, and
Current Line. It's a passage of text that describes an action that
occurs in an application. Logs are important to verify what the program
did right before an issue occurred so that we can learn more about the
bug. We can use the console log in JavaScript to debug using logs. A
debugger is a program that programmers use to test and debug a target
program. It allows the investigation of objects in a more flexible
manner by going through the code line by line. To accomplish this,
simply add the line debugger to the script. The browser pauses execution
on that line and displays the source of the code currently being
executed if the developer tools console is opened. The browser will now
provide debugging methods and tools for debugging. The action of telling
the debugger to run through the program one line at a time is called
stepping. A computer program comprises of many small steps that are
integrated together. There can be a possibility that one of these steps
is incorrect. A \"stack\" of functions is created as your program enters
more and more \"functions.\" For your software, this serves as a
\"trail\" of function calls. This allows you to see how "calling" one
function affects the "current" function. Breakpoints instruct the
debugger where to \"stop\" your program\'s execution so that you can see
what\'s happening. This enables you to access the proper location in
your application quickly rather than going through the entire program.
Computers can only perform one task at a time. As a result, computers
follow the concept of the \"current line\" when running your program.
The control of the program typically flows from the current line to the
next line down the screen, to the following line, and so on. In this
video, you learned about: debugging strategies used to localize an
error, types of errors that one can experience while programming, and
important debugging terminologies.

# 34. Introduction to Debugging Tools {#introduction-to-debugging-tools .unnumbered}

Welcome to "Introduction to Debugging Tools." After watching this video,
you will be able to:

-   Describe debugging tools,

-   and Identify a few common debugging tools.

Browsers today are equipped with a variety of web development tools
referred to as add-ons or extensions. These are commonly used for web
development as well as a variety of other tasks, debugging being one of
the most important. These tools simplify your work by analyzing
potential issues with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript used in the code.

In this video, we will

-   discuss some browser debugging tools which can help you not only
    debug and analyze your code but also inspect HTTP headers,

-   gain access to other FTP source files,

-   and assess a web page\'s accessibility.

A debugging tool is a software program that enables you to debug a
program without having to recompile it or modify its source code.
Programmers use debugging tools to deal with programming errors or to
make changes before a program is released. These tools enable them to
attempt a fix without changing the source code. Debugging tools can also
be used for troubleshooting issues with other applications, such as web
browsers and operating systems. Some of the common debugging tools
include Chrome Developer Tools, Firefox developer tools, Safari Develop
Menu, React Developer Tools, console debugging, and Integrated
Development Environment (IDE)/Visual Studio Code. Let's discuss each in
detail. Chrome developer tools are a set of tools for web developers
which is built directly into the Chrome browser. Which allows you to
debug your JavaScript code quickly. Many developers rely on these tools,
which are the best in the industry. The default JavaScript console is
included in Chrome developer tools, along with tools for network and
performance monitoring and security features. The Console and Network
activity tabs are where most JavaScript debugging happens. The keyboard
shortcuts mentioned here can be used to open the developer console in
Google Chrome: macOS \`CMD\`+\`OPT\`+\`I\` Windows
\`CTRL\`+\`SHIFT\`+\`I\`

In the past, Firefox users relied on Firebug, an extension that provided
them with a set of competitive developer tools. The functionality of
firebug was incorporated into the Firefox Developer Tools available in
the latest versions of Firefox. This put Google Chrome and the Firefox
browser's integrated toolkit on an equal level. To access the developer
tools in Mozilla Firefox, open the browser, click the Firefox menu in
the upper right corner, and click \"More Tools.\" Next, select \"Web
Developer Tools.\" Finally, click \"Console.\" There are options in the
Develop menu to display the JavaScript console, a network, a debugger, a
page element inspector, and a network traffic monitor. The JavaScript
debugging tools provided by Chrome are comparable to the developer tools
in Safari. All browser developer tools are progressively getting better
as they become better equipped to fulfill developers\' demands. To
utilize Safari's built-in developer tools, users must enable the Safari
Develop menu. - First click the \"Safari\" tab and then click
\"Settings.\" - Next, click \"Advanced.\" - Finally, select \"Show
Develop menu in the menu bar.\" The Develop menu will appear in the menu
bar. React Developer Tools, an extension of Chrome DevTools, is a great
source of help if you need to inspect the props or state values in your
React-built application. If you visit a website created using React
after adding the extension, a React tab will be added to the developer
console, displaying properties and state values for any element you
click. This is the most commonly used JavaScript console method. Error
handling or throwing are not done using this method. Instead, it is
employed to print statements in the console. There is console.log()
which is the most common one you\'ll see. When debugging Java
applications, you do not always need to use an IDE. Visual Studio Code,
Microsoft\'s cross-platform source code editor, also supports Java
debugging via a simple debugger for Java extensions. Visual studio code
is an excellent option if you already use it for development and require
a compact and user-friendly Java debugging tool. Visual Studio Code
provides sufficient features for a quick debugging session of your Java
application despite all the complex debugging features that IDE's
debuggers provide. In this video, you learned that: Browsers are
equipped with a variety of web development tools referred to as add-ons
or extensions Debugging tool is a software program that enables you to
debug a program There are some common debugging tools used by
developers.

# 35. Troubleshooting with Chrome DevTools {#troubleshooting-with-chrome-devtools .unnumbered}

Welcome to Troubleshooting with Chrome DevTools! After watching this
video, you will be able to: Describe Chrome DevTools and its various
panels Determine how to access some of the panels\' features Explain how
to use Chrome DevTools to debug HTML and CSS The Google Chrome browser
includes built-in developer tools, also known as DevTools, that allow
developers to edit code directly in the browser, add breakpoints to
detect issues, and debug their code quickly.

There are eleven panels in the DevTools UI. Here\'s a quick listing of
what each panel oversees. Elements: Examine and modify DOM nodes and
style attributes. Console: View and execute JavaScript code. Sources:
Debug JavaScript, set breakpoints, and so on. Network: Monitor and
troubleshoot network-related activities. Performance: Evaluate speed and
optimization Memory: Monitor memory usage and resolve any issues that
arise. Application: Examine local Storage, session Storage, cookies,
Index DB, and so on. Security: Debug certificate issues and other
security concerns Lighthouse: Examine the app\'s quality, performance,
accessibility, SEO, and so on. Recorder panel: Helps you can record the
checkout flow once and measure it regularly Performance Insights panel:
Highlights the key insights in the Insights pane, with actionable
feedback on how to fix issues Let\'s first try to understand how to
access Chrome DevTools. To access Chrome DevTools: Right-click on any
website and select \"inspect." The DevTools will open the Elements panel
and highlight the selected DOM element. To open the console panel, use
the keyboard shortcut CMD + Option + J on Mac or CTRL + SHIFT + J on
Windows. Let\'s now learn how to access the elements panel. To access
the elements panel: Right-click any element on the page and select
\"inspect\" or Click on the elements panel inside Chrome DevTools. That
element should now be highlighted in the DOM tree. To select another
element on the page: Hover over an element on the page and Click once on
the highlighted area that corresponds to the element you want to
inspect. Now that we know how to access the Elements panel let\'s look
at how to use it to edit HTML and CSS. We will first look at how to edit
HTML. When you right-click on an element and choose \"Edit as HTML,\"
you are presented with a text field in which you can fully edit the HTML
content that comprises that element. This is useful if you want to
change the behavior of an element by adding or removing HTML elements
inside or around any element on the page. Since these changes aren\'t
saved in your application\'s source code, they\'re ideal for quickly
testing a new HTML structure without adding and deleting these elements
in your code. Simply refreshing the page allows you to edit the same
component multiple times. You can easily delete and reorder elements in
addition to editing them. Let's now look at how to edit CSS. The Styles
panel is useful for debugging CSS and understanding how CSS works. The
styles panel allows you to preview changes without affecting the
appearance of your website for other visitors. It is not necessary to
refresh your browser to see the changes because they are updated in
real-time. In fact, if you refresh your browser after making changes,
the browser will reload the unmodified version of your website, wiping

out your changes. Using the styles panel for live CSS testing ensures
that the actual code of your live website is not altered. Let\'s now
understand the process of setting a breakpoint in your codes. To create
a breakpoint: Click on the side of the file near the line number and Run
the code that will trigger the breakpoint. The highlighted line of code
indicates that the code has paused execution on that line. So, at this
point, you can inspect specific data in the code by hovering over the
variables you want to examine. This is essential for debugging because
quickly viewing your app's current state at any point will provide you
with valuable insight into how it works. Another way to trigger a
breakpoint is to simply add the following code line to a Javascript
program: debugger; When the code reaches this line, the debugger is
triggered in the same way that a breakpoint would be set in that line.
Let's now look at the logging function. The code has a console.log
function that can be used to output variables or data to the console.
For example, this code outputs the values from 0 to 4 to the console: //
open console to see for (let i = 0; i \< 5; i++)
{console.log(\"value,\", i); } To see the output, either open the
DevTools Console panel or press Esc while in another panel. This opens
the console at the bottom of the screen. Let's now learn how to find
properties in an object. The grep.js snippet searches an object and its
prototypical chain for properties that match a set of criteria. For
example, this instruction will look for all properties in the document
object that match get: grep(document, \'get\'); When you switch to
developer mode in Chrome, it renders a half-sized version of your
webpage. Fortunately, Chrome DevTools allows you to switch between
different mobile screen types and versions in addition to changing the
screen size of a webpage. To access that option: First, toggle on the
Inspect mode. Next, select Responsive from the drop-down menu in the
top-left corner of the DevTools. Lastly, choose your preferred mobile
device. The webpage is then rendered and adjusted to fit the size of the
mobile device you chose. Aside from debugging JavaScript, Chrome
DevTools includes a feature that allows you to assess your website\'s
overall performance based on specific parameters. To use that feature,
follow these steps: In the DevTools window, select the Lighthouse
option. Next, choose the parameters you want to test. Select either
Mobile or Desktop to see how your website performs on different
platforms. In this video, you learned that: DevTools allows developers
to edit code directly in the browser, add breakpoints to detect issues,
and debug their code more quickly. The elements panel is used to examine
and modify DOM nodes and style attributes. The elements panel is used to
edit HTML and CSS.

Setting breakpoints is essential for debugging as it provides valuable
insights into how the app works. The console.log function can be used to
output something to the console, and Chrome DevTools helps switch
between different mobile screen types and versions in addition to
changing the screen size of a webpage.

# 36. Monitoring your Website {#monitoring-your-website .unnumbered}

Welcome to "Monitoring your Website."

After watching this video, you will be able to:

-   explain website monitoring and its advantages,

-   describe automated website monitoring,

-   discuss the types of website monitoring,

-   and define popular website monitoring metrics.

Website monitoring implies evaluating a website or web service for
functionality, performance, or availability. Website monitoring service
ensures that the website is operational and that users are able to
access and interact with it as intended. Continuous monitoring helps
organizations prevent downtime and proactively respond to potential
errors that could have a negative impact. One of the main advantages of
monitoring websites is increased website uptime. Regular monitoring
makes it easier to identify and fix issues like server issues, network
outages, and software bugs that could bring down the website. Website
monitoring helps minimize downtime by quickly identifying the problems
and taking appropriate action. Website monitoring can also help optimize
website performance by identifying and addressing performance issues at
the earliest. Quickly and accurately diagnosing problems in real time
helps websites run efficiently and quickly. Downtime and slow-loading
pages can result in lost sales and revenue. Monitoring helps send alerts
when your search, forms, or logins go wrong. Website monitoring helps
prevent these issues and keeps revenue flowing. Website monitoring can
be done in two ways:

automated monitoring and real user monitoring. Let's discuss each of
them in detail. Automated monitoring means monitoring the performance
and availability of a web application by simulating real user
interactions with it. A network of computers situated close to the
site\'s end users is used for automated website monitoring. This
checkpoint network communicates with a website or service to confirm
that it performs as intended.

The checkpoint performs various steps to complete the process of web
monitoring.

Let's discuss each step in detail. The first step that the checkpoint
performs is configuration. The checkpoint initiates a connection with
the website or service and checks the website at specific intervals. The
second step is testing. The checkpoint tests the website by sending
requests to the server and evaluating the server\'s response time. Other
website features are also examined by the program, including error
rates, page load times, and server resource utilization. Next, the
checkpoint checks the return for specified content. The fourth step is
Real Browser Monitoring (RBM). The checkpoint loads the content into a
real browser. RBM launches a browser and monitors a web application,
mimicking the user\'s interaction with the site.

After real browser monitoring is completed, the checkpoint collects the
data on the website\'s performance and availability and stores it in a
database for analysis. The load time of each element of the page is
recorded when the browser loads the page. This is called performance
monitoring. After performance monitoring is completed, web application
monitoring is performed. It implies tracking various performance metrics
and user behaviors of a web application in real-time. The checkpoint
attempts to sign in, carry out a search, use a shopping cart, or even
finish a transaction while performing web application monitoring.

Finally, the checkpoint reports its findings to the monitoring service
and uses the information to resolve any issues and improve the
website\'s performance and availability.

Let's now discuss the other way of website monitoring, which is Real
User Monitoring (RUM). It is a method of monitoring the performance and
behavior of a web application as experienced by actual users.

It involves tracking and analyzing data generated by the interactions of
real users with the web application, such as page load times, error
rates, and user actions. Script files, agents, cookies, and server-side
code track the website's performance as each site visitor accesses the
site. There are several types of website monitoring that indicate a
\"larger picture\" of the website's performance.

These include: Availability monitoring, Performance monitoring, and
Functionality monitoring.

Let's explore each type in detail. Availability monitoring or uptime
monitoring checks if a website is available and accessible to users,
ensuring that the website is running and can always be used by users. It
checks the availability of web services, domains, and pages. Performance
monitoring checks the speed of a website or service. The frontend and
backend connection tracks the browser load time by performance monitors.
Performance monitors may use RUM technology or synthetic monitoring. RUM
and the Full-Page Check provide the most comprehensive performance data
set. The third type is functionality monitoring.

A web application monitor or transaction monitor tests the functionality
of a website.

Script files are used by these monitors to interact with forms, site
searches, shopping carts, and payment systems. The transaction monitors
interact with a web application in the same way as regular users, and an
alert is sent to the supporting staff in case of any error or downtime
faced. We will now explore some of the popular website monitoring
metrics. These include:

Page Speed, Time to Title, Time to Start Render, Time to Interact, DNS
Lookup Speed, Bounce Rate, and Requests Per Second.

Let's discuss each of them. A page\'s speed is determined by its loading
time and consists of three different metrics: Server response time,
which is the time the server takes to respond and is also called time to
first byte (TTFB); Transfer time, which is the time taken to download an
HTML web page; and Time taken to render a web page in a browser. Time to
title is the time that a website's title takes to appear in a browser.
Time to Start Render is the time the content takes to begin loading,
even if it doesn\'t fully load after an individual makes a request. Time
to Interact measures the time taken before users are able to click
links, type in text fields, scroll, or interact with a website in other
ways. DNS Lookup Speed is the time the Domain Name System (DNS) provider
takes to translate a domain name into an IP address. A slow DNS provider
results in a slow DNS Lookup speed.

Bounce Rate is a website metric that measures the percentage of visitors
who leave a website after only viewing a single page. A high bounce rate
indicates that a large number of visitors are leaving the site quickly,
potentially due to a poor user experience or not finding what they were
looking for. Requests Per Second refers to the number of requests the
server receives every second. It is also referred to as "Throughput" or
"Average Load." In this video, you learned about: website monitoring and
its advantages, the two methods of website monitoring, the steps to
complete the process of automated website monitoring, the three types of
website monitoring: availability monitoring, performance monitoring,
functionality monitoring, and some popular website monitoring metrics.

existing errors, where you first start with the code provided and fix
the deliberate errors in HTML and JavaScript. (2) To save yourself from
testing every code change manually, you will then make your business
logic in JavaScript testable with the help of Jasmine. Write test specs,
fix your logic, and do unit tests every time you make a change. (3)
Finally, in the last part, you will improve on Search Engine
Optimization and enhance your deployment package with the help of
Webpack.

You will need to submit screenshots when requested.
